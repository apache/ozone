## Slides to present about Ozone

This directory contains re-usable slides and diagrams about Ozone which can be used to present Ozone basic features.

Diagrams can be read with the Open source https://github.com/jgraph/drawio tool or with opening the drawio file with https://app.diagrams.net online tool (without installing any external tool).

Slides are created with the open source Libre Office (impress) but also included in PDF form.

Slides are created with using Montserrat fonts (https://github.com/JulietaUla/Montserrat) but any font can work.
