This document provides a high-level comparison of Apache Ozone with other storage technologies.

## Open Source Scale-out Storage Comparison

Ozone is most often compared against other open source storage systems.

| Tech                | Type                  | Consistency         | Scale                                | Big Data Integration | License               | Notes                                                              |
|---------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Ozone**           | Object / File         | Strong              | Exabyte scale, tens of billions keys | Native               | Apache 2.0            | Modern Hadoop-native object store with S3 API                      |
| **HDFS**            | File                  | Strong              | PBs, billions files                  | Native               | Apache 2.0            | Classic Hadoop FS, no S3 API, tight Hadoop integration             |
| **Ceph**            | Object / Block / File | Tunable / Eventual  | Multi-PB, very large                 | Via S3 Gateway/CephFS | LGPLv2.1 / Ceph Foundation | General-purpose: underlying RADOS (object), RGW (object), CephFS (file) |
| **MinIO**           | Object                | Strong              | Petabyte scale                       | Via S3 connectors    | AGPLv3 (SSPL-like)    | Cloud-native S3 API, lightweight, fast, no FS semantics            |
| **Lustre**          | Parallel File (POSIX) | Strong              | PB scale, HPC                        | None                 | GPLv2                 | HPC clusters, high-throughput parallel file system                 |
| **GlusterFS**       | File (POSIX)          | Eventually consistent| Large, multi-PB                      | None                 | GPLv3                 | General-purpose scale-out distributed file storage                 |
| **OpenStack Swift** | Object                | Eventual            | Large, multi-PB                      | Via connectors       | Apache 2.0            | S3-like multi-tenant object storage for private clouds             |

Ozone shines when users are in need of an Apache licensed, strongly consistent storage system that can scale to billions of keys/files and hundreds of PBs to EBs.

## Proprietary Scale-Out Storage Comparison

| Tech                    | Type             | Consistency | Scale                | Big Data Integration | Performance Focus                    | Notes                                                                 |
|-------------------------|------------------|-------------|----------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Isilon (Dell PowerScale)** | File (Scale-Out NAS) | Strong      | PBs, billions of files | Indirect             | High throughput, good mixed IO       | Enterprise NAS, POSIX compliant, good for mixed workloads, backup, analytics |
| **VAST**                | File / Object    | Strong      | PBs                  | Yes, AI workloads    | Ultra-low latency, all-flash NVMe    | All-flash, NFS/S3, great for AI/ML and large unstructured datasets   |
| **WEKA**                | Parallel File    | Strong      | PBs                  | HPC, AI              | Ultra-low latency, high IOPS         | High-performance file, GPU clusters, NFS/SMB/S3                      |
| **Spectrum Scale (GPFS)** | File (POSIX)     | Strong      | PBs                  | HPC, AI              | High throughput, scale-out metadata  | IBM, used in HPC/AI, policy tiering, good POSIX compliance           |
| **Scality**             | Object           | Strong      | PBs                  | Some                 | Good throughput for large objects    | Enterprise S3 API, multi-region, backup archives, hybrid cloud       |
| **Cloudian**            | Object           | Strong      | PBs                  | Some                 | Good throughput for backup/archive   | S3-compatible object storage, ransomware protection, hybrid cloud    |


The proprietary systems offer enterprise-grade quality, but they often require proprietary or certified hardware.
Ozone shines when users look for commodity hardware, open systems and embrace the vibrant Apache big data open source community.

## Cloud-Native Object Storage Comparison

| Tech           | Type                  | Consistency | Scale      | Big Data Integration | Notes                                                                   |
|----------------|-----------------------|-------------|------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **AWS S3**     | Object                | Strong      | Exabyte+   | Native to cloud ecosystem | The de-facto standard for object storage; massive durability, S3 API leader |
| **Azure ABFS** | File/Object (Data Lake Storage) | Strong | Exabyte+   | Azure-native         | HDFS-like semantics for Spark/Hadoop; optimized for analytics           |
| **Google GCS** | Object                | Strong      | Exabyte+   | Native to cloud ecosystem | Globally distributed; strong consistency; well-integrated with BigQuery |
| **OCI Object Storage** | Object        | Strong      | Exabyte+   | Via S3 API & native services | Oracle’s S3-compatible storage; integrates with OCI Data Flow           |
| **Alibaba OSS** | Object               | Strong      | Exabyte+   | Via S3 API & native services | S3-compatible, huge China/APAC footprint                                |
| **IBM Cloud Object Storage** | Object  | Strong      | Exabyte+   | Via S3 API & native services | S3-compatible, geo-dispersed erasure coding for durability              |

These cloud storage offerings are only available from their respective public cloud vendors. In contrast, Ozone runs on-prem or in your private cloud, giving you full control.

## Summary
In summary, Ozone is the best fit in the following scenarios:

1. Large on-prem big data clusters migrating from HDFS.
2. You want S3 APIs but need strong Hadoop integration.
3. You want to avoid vendor lock-in and grow cost-effectively on commodity hardware.
4. You’re building a private or hybrid cloud with other open-source tools.
