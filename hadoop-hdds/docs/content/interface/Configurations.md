The following table lists configuration properties available for the Ozone client. These properties can be set in ozone-site.xml to control client behavior.

| Property Name | Default Value | Description |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| ozone.client.stream.buffer.flush.size | 16MB | Size which determines at what buffer position a partial flush will be initiated during write. It should be a multiple of ozone.client.stream.buffer.size |
| ozone.client.stream.buffer.size | 4MB | The size of chunks the client will send to the server |
| ozone.client.datastream.buffer.flush.size | 16MB | The boundary at which putBlock is executed |
| ozone.client.datastream.min.packet.size | 1MB | The maximum size of the ByteBuffer (used via ratis streaming) |
| ozone.client.datastream.window.size | 64MB | Maximum size of BufferList (used for retry) size per BlockDataStreamOutput instance |
| ozone.client.datastream.pipeline.mode | true | Streaming write supports both pipeline mode (datanode1->datanode2->datanode3) and star mode (datanode1->datanode2, datanode1->datanode3). By default, pipeline mode is used. |
| ozone.client.stream.buffer.increment | 0B | Buffer (defined by ozone.client.stream.buffer.size) will be incremented with this step. If zero, the full buffer will be created at once. Setting it to a value between 0 and ozone.client.stream.buffer.size can reduce memory usage for very small keys, but has a performance overhead. |
| ozone.client.stream.buffer.flush.delay | true | Default true. When calling flush(), determines whether the data in the current buffer is greater than ozone.client.stream.buffer.size. If greater, then send buffer to the datanode. Can be turned off by setting this to false. |
| ozone.client.stream.buffer.max.size | 32MB | Size which determines at what buffer position write call will be blocked till acknowledgement of the first partial flush happens by all servers. |
| ozone.client.max.retries | 5 | Maximum number of retries by Ozone Client on encountering exception while writing a key |
| ozone.client.retry.interval | 0 | Time duration a client will wait before retrying a write key request on encountering an exception. By default there is no wait |
| ozone.client.read.max.retries | 3 | Maximum number of retries by Ozone Client on encountering connectivity exception when reading a key. |
| ozone.client.read.retry.interval | 1 | Time duration in seconds a client will wait before retrying a read key request on encountering a connectivity exception from Datanodes. By default the interval is 1 second |
| ozone.client.checksum.type | CRC32 | The checksum type [NONE/ CRC32/ CRC32C/ SHA256/ MD5] determines which algorithm would be used to compute checksum for chunk data. Default checksum type is CRC32. |
| ozone.client.bytes.per.checksum | 16KB | Checksum will be computed for every bytes per checksum number of bytes and stored sequentially. The minimum value for this config is 8KB. |
| ozone.client.verify.checksum | true | Ozone client to verify checksum of the checksum blocksize data. |
| ozone.client.max.ec.stripe.write.retries | 10 | Ozone EC client to retry stripe to new block group on failures. |
| ozone.client.ec.stripe.queue.size | 2 | The max number of EC stripes can be buffered in client before flushing into datanodes. |
| ozone.client.exclude.nodes.expiry.time | 600000 | Time after which an excluded node is reconsidered for writes. If the value is zero, the node is excluded for the life of the client |
| ozone.client.ec.reconstruct.stripe.read.pool.limit | 30 | Thread pool max size for parallel read available ec chunks to reconstruct the whole stripe. |
| ozone.client.ec.reconstruct.stripe.write.pool.limit | 30 | Thread pool max size for parallel write available ec chunks to reconstruct the whole stripe. |
| ozone.client.checksum.combine.mode | COMPOSITE_CRC | The combined checksum type [MD5MD5CRC / COMPOSITE_CRC] determines which algorithm would be used to compute file checksum. COMPOSITE_CRC calculates the combined CRC of the whole file, where the lower-level chunk/block checksums are combined into file-level checksum. MD5MD5CRC calculates the MD5 of MD5 of checksums of individual chunks. Default checksum type is COMPOSITE_CRC. |
| ozone.client.fs.default.bucket.layout | FILE_SYSTEM_OPTIMIZED | The bucket layout used by buckets created using OFS. Valid values include FILE_SYSTEM_OPTIMIZED and LEGACY |
| ozone.client.hbase.enhancements.allowed | false | When set to false, client-side HBase enhancement-related Ozone (experimental) features are disabled (not allowed to be enabled) regardless of whether those configs are set. |
| ozone.client.incremental.chunk.list | false | Client PutBlock request can choose incremental chunk list rather than full chunk list to optimize performance. Critical to HBase. EC does not support this feature. Can be enabled only when ozone.client.hbase.enhancements.allowed = true |
| ozone.client.stream.putblock.piggybacking | false | Allow PutBlock to be piggybacked in WriteChunk requests if the chunk is small. Can be enabled only when ozone.client.hbase.enhancements.allowed = true |
| ozone.client.key.write.concurrency | 1 | Maximum concurrent writes allowed on each key. Defaults to 1 which matches the behavior before HDDS-9844. For unlimited write concurrency, set this to -1 or any negative integer value. Any value other than 1 is effective only when ozone.client.hbase.enhancements.allowed = true |
