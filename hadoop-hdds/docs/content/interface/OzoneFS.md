summary: Hadoop Compatible file system allows any application that expects an HDFS like interface to work against Ozone with zero changes. Frameworks like Apache Spark, YARN and Hive work against Ozone without needing any change.

The Hadoop compatible file system interface allows storage backends like Ozone
to be easily integrated into Hadoop eco-system.  Ozone file system is an
Hadoop compatible file system. Currently, Ozone supports two scheme: o3fs and ofs.
The biggest difference between the o3fs and ofsï¼Œis that o3fs supports operations 
only at a single bucket, while ofs supports operations across all volumes and buckets.
you can Refer to "Differences from existing o3FS "in ofs.md for details of the differences.

## Setting up the o3fs

To create an ozone file system, we have to choose a bucket where the file system would live. This bucket will be used as the backend store for OzoneFileSystem. All the files and directories will be stored as keys in this bucket.

Please run the following commands to create a volume and bucket, if you don't have them already.

{{< highlight bash >}}
ozone sh volume create /volume
ozone sh bucket create /volume/bucket
{{< /highlight >}}

Once this is created, please make sure that bucket exists via the _list volume_ or _list bucket_ commands.

Please add the following entry to the core-site.xml.

{{< highlight xml >}}
<property>
  <name>fs.AbstractFileSystem.o3fs.impl</name>
  <value>org.apache.hadoop.fs.ozone.OzFs</value>
</property>
<property>
  <name>fs.defaultFS</name>
  <value>o3fs://bucket.volume</value>
</property>
{{< /highlight >}}

This will make this bucket to be the default Hadoop compatible file system and register the o3fs file system type.

You also need to add the ozone-filesystem-hadoop3.jar file to the classpath:

{{< highlight bash >}}
export HADOOP_CLASSPATH=/opt/ozone/share/ozonefs/lib/hadoop-ozone-filesystem-hadoop3-*.jar:$HADOOP_CLASSPATH
{{< /highlight >}}

(Note: with Hadoop 2.x, use the `hadoop-ozone-filesystem-hadoop2-*.jar`)

Once the default Filesystem has been setup, users can run commands like ls, put, mkdir, etc.
For example,

{{< highlight bash >}}
hdfs dfs -ls /
{{< /highlight >}}

or

{{< highlight bash >}}
hdfs dfs -mkdir /users
{{< /highlight >}}


Or put command etc. In other words, all programs like Hive, Spark, and Distcp will work against this file system.
Please note that any keys created/deleted in the bucket using methods apart from OzoneFileSystem will show up as directories and files in the Ozone File System.

Note: Bucket and volume names are not allowed to have a period in them.

Moreover, the filesystem URI can take a fully qualified form with the OM host and an optional port as a part of the path following the volume name.
For example, you can specify both host and port:

{{< highlight bash>}}
hdfs dfs -ls o3fs://bucket.volume.om-host.example.com:5678/key
{{< /highlight >}}

When the port number is not specified, it will be retrieved from config key `ozone.om.address`
if defined; or it will fall back to the default port `9862`.
For example, we have `ozone.om.address` configured as following in `ozone-site.xml`:

{{< highlight xml >}}
  <property>
    <name>ozone.om.address</name>
    <value>0.0.0.0:6789</value>
  </property>
{{< /highlight >}}

When we run command:

{{< highlight bash>}}
hdfs dfs -ls o3fs://bucket.volume.om-host.example.com/key
{{< /highlight >}}

The above command is essentially equivalent to:

{{< highlight bash>}}
hdfs dfs -ls o3fs://bucket.volume.om-host.example.com:6789/key
{{< /highlight >}}

Note: Only port number from the config is used in this case, 
whereas the host name in the config `ozone.om.address` is ignored.

## Setting up the ofs
This is just a general introduction. For more detailed usage, you can refer to ofs.md.

Please add the following entry to the core-site.xml.

{{< highlight xml >}}
<property>
  <name>fs.ofs.impl</name>
  <value>org.apache.hadoop.fs.ozone.RootedOzoneFileSystem</value>
</property>
<property>
  <name>fs.defaultFS</name>
  <value>ofs://om-host.example.com/</value>
</property>
{{< /highlight >}}

This will make all the volumes and buckets to be the default Hadoop compatible file system and register the ofs file system type.

You also need to add the ozone-filesystem-hadoop3.jar file to the classpath:

{{< highlight bash >}}
export HADOOP_CLASSPATH=/opt/ozone/share/ozonefs/lib/hadoop-ozone-filesystem-hadoop3-*.jar:$HADOOP_CLASSPATH
{{< /highlight >}}

(Note: with Hadoop 2.x, use the `hadoop-ozone-filesystem-hadoop2-*.jar`)

Once the default Filesystem has been setup, users can run commands like ls, put, mkdir, etc.
For example:

{{< highlight bash >}}
hdfs dfs -ls /
{{< /highlight >}}

Note that ofs works on all buckets and volumes. Users can create buckets and volumes using mkdir, such as create volume named volume1 and  bucket named bucket1:

{{< highlight bash >}}
hdfs dfs -mkdir /volume1
hdfs dfs -mkdir /volume1/bucket1
{{< /highlight >}}


Or use the put command to write a file to the bucket.

{{< highlight bash >}}
hdfs dfs -put /etc/hosts /volume1/bucket1/test
{{< /highlight >}}
