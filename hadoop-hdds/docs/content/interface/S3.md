Ozone provides S3 compatible REST interface to use the object store data with any S3 compatible tools.

S3 buckets are stored under the `/s3v` volume.

## Getting started

S3 Gateway is a separated component which provides the S3 compatible APIs. It should be started additional to the regular Ozone components.

You can start a docker based cluster, including the S3 gateway from the release package.

Go to the `compose/ozone` directory, and start the server:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --scale datanode=3
```

You can access the S3 gateway at `http://localhost:9878`

## URL Schema

Ozone S3 gateway supports both the virtual-host-style URL s3 bucket addresses (eg. http://bucketname.host:9878) and the path-style addresses (eg. http://host:9878/bucketname)

By default it uses the path-style addressing. To use virtual host style URLs set your main domain name in your `ozone-site.xml`:

```xml
<property>
   <name>ozone.s3g.domain.name</name>
   <value>s3g.internal</value>
</property>
```

## Implemented REST Endpoints

The Ozone S3 Gateway implements a substantial subset of the Amazon S3 REST API. The tables below summarize each API’s support status, its feature, and any relevant notes, including known deviations from AWS S3 behavior.

### Bucket Operations

| **API Name**                                                                                      | **Feature** | **Note** |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|----------|
| ✅ [ListBuckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListBuckets.html)             | Lists all buckets owned by the authenticated user. | Returns the full bucket list. |
| ✅ [CreateBucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateBucket.html)           | Creates a new bucket. | **Non-compliant behavior:** The default bucket ACL may include extra group permissions instead of being strictly private. Bucket names must adhere to S3 naming conventions. |
| ✅ [HeadBucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_HeadBucket.html)               | Checks for the existence of a bucket. | Returns a 200 status if the bucket exists. |
| ✅ [DeleteBucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteBucket.html)           | Deletes a bucket. | Bucket must be empty before deletion. |
| ✅ [GetBucketLocation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketLocation.html) | Retrieves the location (region) of a bucket. | Typically returns a default region (e.g., `us-east-1`), which may differ from AWS if region-specific responses are expected. |

### Object Operations

| **API Name**                                                                              | **Feature** | **Note** |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|----------|
| ✅ [GetObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html)         | Retrieves the contents of an object. | **Non-compliant behavior:** For non-existent objects, Ozone may return a generic 404 without the structured XML error body defined by AWS S3. |
| ✅ [HeadObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_HeadObject.html)       | Retrieves metadata for an object. | Similar to GET Object, error responses for missing objects might lack detailed AWS-style error XML. |
| ✅ [PutObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObject.html)         | Uploads a new object. | Supports both single PUT and multipart uploads. **Non-compliant behavior:** Any ACL headers provided in the request are ignored. |
| ✅ [DeleteObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteObject.html)   | Deletes a single object. | Returns standard error codes for missing objects. |
| ✅ [DeleteObjects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteObjects.html) | Deletes multiple objects in one request. | Bulk delete operation with aggregated error reporting. |
| ✅ [CopyObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html)       | Copies an object (intra- or inter-bucket). | Supports metadata directives (COPY/REPLACE). **Non-compliant behavior:** Self-copying for metadata updates may differ slightly from AWS S3. |
| ✅ [ListObjectsV2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListObjectsV2.html) | Lists objects in a bucket with filtering and pagination. | Supports prefix, delimiter, and continuation tokens. |

### Object Tagging Operations

| **API Name**                                                                                          | **Feature** | **Note** |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|----------|
| ✅ [PutObjectTagging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObjectTagging.html)       | Adds or updates tags on an object. | Fully supported; updates replace any existing tag set. |
| ✅ [GetObjectTagging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObjectTagging.html)       | Retrieves the tag set of an object. | Returns the tag set as defined by the S3 API. |
| ✅ [DeleteObjectTagging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteObjectTagging.html) | Removes the tag set from an object. | Clears all tags associated with the object. |

### Multipart Upload Operations

| **API Name** | **Feature**                                               | **Note**                                                                                                                    |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ✅ [CreateMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html) | Starts a multipart upload session.                        | Returns an UploadId for subsequent parts.                                                                                   |
| ✅ [UploadPart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html) | Uploads an individual part for a multipart upload.        | Part numbering and ETag computation follow AWS semantics.                                                                   |
| ✅ [ListMultipartUploads](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListMultipartUploads.html) | Lists in-progress multipart uploads in a bucket.          | Up to 1000 multipart uploads are returned in a batch by default.                                                            |
| ✅ [ListParts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListParts.html) | Lists uploaded parts for an in-progress multipart upload. | Supports pagination if many parts exist.                                                                                    |
| ✅ [CompleteMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CompleteMultipartUpload.html) | Assembles all uploaded parts into a final object.         | Returns an ETag that follows AWS multipart rules.                                                                           |
| ✅ [AbortMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_AbortMultipartUpload.html) | Aborts an in-progress multipart upload.                   | Frees up storage used by uploaded parts. Incomplete multipart uploads older than 7 days are automatically aborted by Ozone. |

### Additional Operations

| **API Name** | **Feature** | **Note** |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| ✅ Generate Presigned URL | Generates a temporary URL for accessing an object. | Uses AWS Signature V4. **Non-compliant behavior:** The generated URL may include a fixed default region rather than dynamically reflecting the bucket’s location. Currently, Ozone only supports generating presigned URLs for `GetObject`. Support for other operations is tracked in [HDDS-5195](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDDS-5195) and [HDDS-13393](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDDS-13393). |

> **Additional Notes:**
> - **Advanced Features Not Supported:**
>   - **ACLs, Bucket Policies, CORS Configuration, and Website Hosting:** These are not fully implemented; Ozone uses an internal permission model that deviates from AWS S3.
>   - **Bucket Versioning, Object Locking, Server-Side Encryption, and S3 Select:** These features are currently not supported.
>   - **Conditional Requests:** Support for conditional requests (e.g., `If-Match`, `If-None-Match`) is planned and tracked in [HDDS-13117](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDDS-13117).
>   - **Lifecycle configuration, cross region replication, S3 event notifications** are being implemented and in the roadmap.
> - While Ozone S3 Gateway provides extensive support for common S3 operations, users should be aware of the above non-compliant behaviors and limitations when integrating with applications expecting full AWS S3 functionality.
> - While Ozone S3 Gateway does not support S3 Server-Side Encryption, it does support encrypted buckets using Apache Ranger KMS. For more information, see the [Transparent Data Encryption]({{< relref "security/SecuringTDE.md" >}}) documentation.

## Security

If security is not enabled, you can *use* **any** AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

If security is enabled, you can get the key and the secret with the `ozone s3 getsecret` command (*Kerberos based authentication is required).

```bash
kinit -kt /etc/security/keytabs/testuser.keytab testuser/scm@EXAMPLE.COM
ozone s3 getsecret
awsAccessKey=testuser/scm@EXAMPLE.COM
awsSecret=c261b6ecabf7d37d5f9ded654b1c724adac9bd9f13e247a235e567e8296d2999
```

Note: Starting in Ozone 1.4.0, the secret will be **shown only once** when generated with `getsecret`. If the secret is lost, the user would have to `revokesecret` first before regenerating a new secret with `getsecret`.

Now, you can use the key and the secret to access the S3 endpoint:

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=testuser/scm@EXAMPLE.COM
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=c261b6ecabf7d37d5f9ded654b1c724adac9bd9f13e247a235e567e8296d2999
aws s3api --endpoint http://localhost:9878 create-bucket --bucket bucket1
```

To invalidate/revoke the secret, use `ozone s3 revokesecret` command. Parameter '-y' can be appended to skip the interactive confirmation.

```bash
ozone s3 revokesecret
Enter 'y' to confirm S3 secret revocation for 'testuser/scm@EXAMPLE.COM': y
S3 secret revoked.
```

Ozone Manager administrators can run `ozone s3 getsecret` and `ozone s3 revokesecret` command with `-u` parameter to specify another users.

```bash
# Obtained Kerberos TGT for testuser/scm@EXAMPLE.COM with kinit,
# testuser/scm@EXAMPLE.COM is an OM admin.
ozone s3 getsecret -u om/om@EXAMPLE.COM
awsAccessKey=om/om@EXAMPLE.COM
awsSecret=1e9379d0424cce6669b1a501ff14834e46dee004ee868b41a313b49eabcfb68f

ozone s3 revokesecret -u om/om@EXAMPLE.COM -y
S3 secret revoked.
```

## Expose any volume

Ozone has one more element in the name-space hierarchy compared to S3: the volumes. By default, all the buckets of the `/s3v` volume can be accessed with S3 interface but only the (Ozone) buckets of the `/s3v` volumes are exposed.

To make any other buckets available with the S3 interface a "symbolic linked" bucket can be created:

```bash
ozone sh volume create /s3v
ozone sh volume create /vol1

ozone sh bucket create /vol1/bucket1
ozone sh bucket link /vol1/bucket1 /s3v/common-bucket
```

This example expose the `/vol1/bucket1` Ozone bucket as an S3 compatible `common-bucket` via the S3 interface.

(Note: the implementation details of the bucket-linking feature can be found in the [design doc]({{< ref "design/volume-management.md">}}))

## Clients

### AWS Cli

`aws` CLI could be used by specifying the custom REST endpoint.

```bash
aws s3api --endpoint http://localhost:9878 create-bucket --bucket buckettest
```

Or

```bash
aws s3 ls --endpoint http://localhost:9878 s3://buckettest
```

## Compatible third-party applications
Ozone's S3 Gateway enables integration with a wide range of cloud-native and analytics applications. Here are some examples of tools and platforms known to work with Ozone (in alphabetical order):

* [Clickhouse](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/integrations/s3)
* [Fluentd](https://docs.fluentd.org/output/s3) can send logs directly to Ozone via the S3 Gateway.
* [JuiceFS](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/s3_gateway/)
* [Starburst](https://docs.starburst.io/latest/connector/starburst-ozone.html) (Starburst also supports Ozone `ofs://`)
* [Teradata NOS](https://docs.teradata.com/r/Enterprise_IntelliFlex_VMware/Teradata-VantageTM-Native-Object-Store-Getting-Started-Guide-17.20)
* [CyberDuck](https://cyberduck.io/) See the [tutorial page](CyberDuckOzoneS3.md)

This list is not exhaustive—any application that supports the S3 protocol can potentially connect to Ozone, making it easy to adopt Ozone in modern data pipelines and cloud-native workflows.
