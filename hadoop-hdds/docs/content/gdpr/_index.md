{{<jumbotron title="GDPR compliance in Ozone">}}
          The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a law that governs how personal data should be handled. This is an European Union law, but due to the nature of software oftentimes spills into other geographies.
          Ozone supports GDPR's Right to Erasure(Right to be Forgotten).
