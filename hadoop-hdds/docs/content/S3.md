Ozone provides S3 compatible REST interface to use the object store data with any S3 compatible tools.

## Getting started

S3 Gateway is a separated component which provides the S3 compatible. It should be started additional to the regular Ozone components.

You can start a docker based cluster, including the S3 gateway from the release package.

Go to the `compose/ozones3` directory, and start the server:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

You can access the S3 gateway at `http://localhost:9878`

## URL Schema

Ozone S3 gateway supports both the virtual-host-style URL s3 bucket addresses (eg. http://bucketname.host:9878) and the path-style addresses (eg. http://host:9878/bucketname)

By default it uses the path-style addressing. To use virtual host style URLs set your main domain name in your `ozone-site.xml`:

```xml
<property>
   <name>ozone.s3g.domain.name</name>
   <value>s3g.internal</value>
</property>
```

## Bucket browser

Buckets could be browsed from the browser by adding `?browser=true` to the bucket URL.

For example the content of the 'testbucket' could be checked from the browser using the URL http://localhost:9878/testbucket?browser=true


## Implemented REST endpoints

Operations on S3Gateway service:

Endpoint    | Status      |
------------|-------------|
GET service | implemented |

Operations on Bucket:

Endpoint                            | Status      | Notes
------------------------------------|-------------|---------------
GET Bucket (List Objects) Version 2 | implemented |
HEAD Bucket                         | implemented |
DELETE Bucket                       | implemented |
PUT Bucket (Create bucket)          | implemented |
Delete Multiple Objects (POST)      | implemented |

Operation on Objects:

Endpoint                            | Status          | Notes
------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------
PUT Object                          | implemented     |
GET Object                          | implemented     | Range headers are not supported
Multipart Uplad                     | not implemented |
DELETE Object                       | implemented     |
HEAD Object                         | implemented     |


## Security

Security is not yet implemented, you can *use* any AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

Note: Ozone has a notion for 'volumes' which is missing from the S3 Rest endpoint. Under the hood S3 bucket names are mapped to Ozone 'volume/bucket' locations (depending on the given authentication information).

To show the storage location of a S3 bucket, use the `ozone sh bucket path <bucketname>` command.

```
aws s3api --endpoint-url http://localhost:9878 create-bucket --bucket=bucket1

ozone sh bucket path bucket1
Volume name for S3Bucket is : s3thisisakey
Ozone FileSystem Uri is : o3fs://bucket1.s3thisisakey
```

## Clients

### AWS Cli

`aws` CLI could be used with specifying the custom REST endpoint.

```
aws s3api --endpoint http://localhost:9878 create-bucket --bucket buckettest
```

Or

```
aws s3 ls --endpoint http://localhost:9878 s3://buckettest
```

### S3 Fuse driver (goofys)

Goofys is a S3 FUSE driver. It could be used to mount any Ozone bucket as posix file system:


```
goofys --endpoint http://localhost:9878 bucket1 /mount/bucket1
```
