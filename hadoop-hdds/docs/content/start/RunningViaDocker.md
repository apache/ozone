 * docker and docker-compose
{{< /requirements >}}

* Download the Ozone binary tarball and untar it.

* Go to the directory where the docker compose files exist and tell
`docker-compose` to start Ozone in the background. This will start a small
ozone instance on your machine.

{{< highlight bash >}}
cd compose/ozone/

docker-compose up -d
{{< /highlight >}}

To verify that ozone is working as expected, let us log into a data node and
run _freon_, the load generator for Ozone. The ```exec datanode bash``` command
will open a bash shell on the datanode.

The `ozone freon` command is executed within the datanode container. You can quit freon via CTRL-C any time. The
```rk``` profile instructs freon to generate random keys.

{{< highlight bash >}}
docker-compose exec datanode bash
ozone freon rk
{{< /highlight >}}

You can check out the **OzoneManager UI** at http://localhost:9874/ to see the
activity generated by freon.
While you are there, please don't forget to check out the ozone configuration explorer.

***Congratulations, You have just run your first ozone cluster.***

To shutdown the cluster, please run
{{< highlight bash >}}
docker-compose down
{{< /highlight >}}
