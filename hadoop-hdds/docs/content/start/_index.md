<h2>Running Ozone from an Official Release</h2>

 Apache Ozone can also be run from the official release packages. Along with the official source releases, we also release a set of convenience binary packages. It is easy to run these binaries in different configurations.

  {{<card title="Deploying Ozone on a physical cluster" link="start/OnPrem" link-text="On-Prem Ozone Cluster" image="start/hadoop.png">}}
Ozone is designed to work concurrently with HDFS. The physical cluster instructions explain each component of Ozone and how to deploy with maximum control.
