# Apache Hadoop Ozone

<img src="ozone-usage.png" style="max-width: 60%;"/>

*_Ozone is a scalable, redundant, and distributed object store for Hadoop. <p>
Apart from scaling to billions of objects of varying sizes,
Ozone can function effectively in containerized environments
like Kubernetes._* <p>

Applications like Apache Spark, Hive and YARN, work without any modifications when using Ozone. Ozone comes with a [Java client library]({{<
ref "JavaApi.md"
>}}), [S3 protocol support] ({{< ref "S3.md" >}}), and a [command line interface]
({{< ref "shell/_index.md" >}})  which makes it easy to use Ozone.

Ozone consists of volumes, buckets, and Keys:

* Volumes are similar to user accounts. Only administrators can create or delete volumes.
* Buckets are similar to directories. A bucket can contain any number of keys,  but buckets cannot contain other buckets.
* Keys are similar to files. A bucket can contain any number of keys.
