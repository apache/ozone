Apache Rangerâ„¢ is a framework to enable, monitor and manage comprehensive data
security across the Hadoop platform. The next version(any version after 1.20)
of Apache Ranger is aware of Ozone, and can manage an Ozone cluster.


To use Apache Ranger, you must have Apache Ranger installed in your Hadoop
Cluster. For installation instructions of Apache Ranger, Please take a look
at the [Apache Ranger website](https://ranger.apache.org/index.html).

If you have a working Apache Ranger installation that is aware of Ozone, then
configuring Ozone to work with Apache Ranger is trivial. You have to enable
the ACLs support and set the acl authorizer class inside Ozone to be Ranger
authorizer. Please add the following properties to the ozone-site.xml.

Property|Value
--------|------------------------------------------------------------
ozone.acl.enabled         | true
ozone.acl.authorizer.class| org.apache.ranger.authorization.ozone.authorizer.RangerOzoneAuthorizer
