Apache Rangerâ„¢ is a framework to enable, monitor and manage comprehensive data
security across the Hadoop platform. Apache Ranger has supported Ozone authentication 
since version 2.0. However, due to some bugs in 2.0, Apache Ranger 
2.1 and later versions are recommended.


To use Apache Ranger, you must have Apache Ranger installed in your Hadoop
Cluster. For installation instructions of Apache Ranger, Please take a look
at the [Apache Ranger website](https://ranger.apache.org/index.html).

If you have a working Apache Ranger installation that is aware of Ozone, then
configuring Ozone to work with Apache Ranger is trivial. You have to enable
the ACLs support and set the acl authorizer class inside Ozone to be Ranger
authorizer. Please add the following properties to the ozone-site.xml.

Property|Value
--------|------------------------------------------------------------
ozone.acl.enabled         | true
ozone.acl.authorizer.class| org.apache.ranger.authorization.ozone.authorizer.RangerOzoneAuthorizer

The Ranger permissions corresponding to the Ozone operations are as follows:

| operation&permission | Volume  permission | Bucket permission | Key permission |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Create  volume | CREATE | | |
| List volume | LIST | | |
| Get volume Info | READ | | |
| Delete volume | DELETE | | |
| Create  bucket | READ | CREATE | |
| List bucket | LIST, READ | | |
| Get bucket info | READ | READ | |
| Delete bucket | READ | DELETE | |
| List key | READ | LIST, READ | |
| Write key | READ | READ | CREATE, WRITE |
| Read key | READ | READ | READ |
