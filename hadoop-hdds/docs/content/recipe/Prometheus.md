[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) is an open-source monitoring server developed under under the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/).

Ozone supports Prometheus out of the box. The servers start a prometheus
compatible metrics endpoint where all the available hadoop metrics are published in prometheus exporter format.

## Prerequisites

 1. [Install the and start]({{< ref "start/RunningViaDocker.md" >}}) an Ozone cluster.
 2. [Download](https://prometheus.io/download/#prometheus) the prometheus binary.

## Monitoring with prometheus

(1) To enable the Prometheus metrics endpoint you need to add a new configuration to the `ozone-site.xml` file:

```
  <property>
    <name>hdds.prometheus.endpoint.enabled</name>
    <value>true</value>
  </property>
```

_Note_: for Docker compose based pseudo cluster put the `OZONE-SITE.XML_hdds.prometheus.endpoint.enabled=true` line to the `docker-config` file.

(2) Restart the Ozone Manager and Storage Container Manager and check the prometheus endpoints:

 * http://scm:9874/prom

 * http://ozoneManager:9876/prom

(3) Create a prometheus.yaml configuration with the previous endpoints:

```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval:     15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: ozone
    metrics_path: /prom
    static_configs:
     - targets:
        - "scm:9876"
        - "ozoneManager:9874"
```

(4) Start with prometheus from the directory where you have the prometheus.yaml file:

```
prometheus
```

(5) Check the active targets in the prometheus web-ui:

http://localhost:9090/targets

(6) Check any metrics on the prometheus web ui. For example:

http://localhost:9090/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.expr=om_metrics_num_key_allocate&g0.tab=1

## Note

The ozone distribution contains a ready-to-use, dockerized environment to try out ozone and prometheus. It can be found under `compose/ozoneperf` directory.

```bash
cd compose/ozoneperf
docker-compose up -d
```
