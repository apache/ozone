This tutorial demonstrates how to access Apache Ozone from Python using **Boto3**, via Ozone's S3 Gateway, with Ozone running in Docker.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed.
- Python 3.x environment.

## Steps

### 1️⃣ Start Ozone in Docker

Download the latest Docker Compose file for Ozone and start the cluster with 3 DataNodes:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/ozone-docker/refs/heads/latest/docker-compose.yaml
docker compose up -d --scale datanode=3
```

### 2️⃣ Connect to the SCM Container

```bash
docker exec -it weichiu-scm-1 bash
```
> Change the container id `weichiu-scm-1` to your actual container id.

Create a a **bucket** inside the volume **s3v**:

```bash
ozone sh bucket create s3v/bucket
```

### 3️⃣ Install Boto3 in Your Python Environment

```bash
pip install boto3
```

### 4️⃣ Access Ozone via Boto3 and the S3 Gateway

Create a Python script (`ozone_boto3_example.py`) with the following content:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
import boto3

# Create a local file to upload
with open("localfile.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Hello from Ozone via Boto3!\n")

# Configure Boto3 client
s3 = boto3.client(
    's3',
    endpoint_url='http://s3g:9878',
    aws_access_key_id='ozone-access-key',
    aws_secret_access_key='ozone-secret-key'
)

# List buckets
response = s3.list_buckets()
print("Buckets:", response['Buckets'])

# Upload the file
s3.upload_file('localfile.txt', 'bucket', 'file.txt')
print("Uploaded 'localfile.txt' to 'bucket/file.txt'")

# Download the file back
s3.download_file('bucket', 'file.txt', 'downloaded.txt')
print("Downloaded 'file.txt' as 'downloaded.txt'")
```

Run the script:

```bash
python ozone_boto3_example.py
```

✅ You have now accessed Ozone from Python using Boto3 and verified both upload and download operations.

## Notes

- The S3 Gateway listens on port `9878` by default.
- The bucket name used in Boto3 should match the one created inside your `s3v` volume.
- Make sure the S3 Gateway container (`s3g`) is up and running. You can check using `docker ps`.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **Access Denied or Bucket Not Found**: Ensure that the bucket name exists and matches exactly (Ozone S3 Gateway uses flat bucket names).
- **Connection Refused**: Check that the S3 Gateway container is running and accessible at the specified endpoint.
- **Timeout or DNS Issues**: Try replacing `weichiu-s3g-1` with `localhost` or the actual IP address depending on how your Docker network is set up.
