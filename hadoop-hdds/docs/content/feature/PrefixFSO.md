The prefix based FileSystem optimization feature supports atomic rename and
 delete of any directory at any level in the namespace. Also, it will perform
  rename and delete of any directory in a deterministic/constant time.

Note: This feature works only when `ozone.om.enable.filesystem.paths` is
 enabled which means that Hadoop Compatible File System compatibility is
  favored instead of S3 compatibility. Some irregular S3 key names may be
   rejected or normalized.

This feature is strongly recommended to be turned ON when Ozone buckets are
 mainly used via Hadoop compatible interfaces, especially with high number of
  files in deep directory hierarchy.

## OzoneManager Metadata layout format
OzoneManager supports two metadata layout formats - legacy and prefix.

Legacy is the existing OM metadata format, which stores key entry with full path
 name. In Prefix based optimization, OM metadata format stores intermediate
  directories into `DirectoryTable` and files into `FileTable` as shown in the
   below picture. The key to the table is the name of a directory or a file
    prefixed by the unique identifier of its parent directory, `<parent
     unique-id>/<filename>`.

## Configuration
By default the feature is disabled. It can be enabled with the following
 settings in `ozone-site.xml`:

```XML
<property>
   <name>ozone.om.enable.filesystem.paths</name>
   <value>true</value>
</property>
<property>
   <name>ozone.om.metadata.layout</name>
   <value>PREFIX</value>
</property>
```
