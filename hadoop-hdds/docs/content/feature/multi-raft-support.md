## Multi-Raft in Datanodes

Multi-Raft support allows a Datanode to participate
multiple Ratis replication groups (pipelines) at the same time
for improving write throughput and ensuring better utilization
of disk and network resources.
This is particularly useful when Datanodes have multiple disks
or the network has a very high bandwidth.

### Background

The early Ozone versions supported only one Raft pipeline per Datanode.
This limited its concurrent write handling capacity for replicated data
and led to under-utilization of resources.
The use of Multi-Raft tremendously improved the resource utilization.

## Prerequisites
- Ozone 0.5.0 or later
- Replication type: RATIS
- Multiple metadata directories on each Datanode
  (via `hdds.container.ratis.datanode.storage.dir`)
  - Adequate CPU, memory, and network bandwidth

## How It Works
SCM can now create overlapping pipelines:
each Datanode can join multiple Raft groups
up to a configurable limit.
This boosts concurrency and avoids idle nodes and idle disks.
Raft logs are stored separately on different metadata directories
in order to reduce disk contention.
Ratis handles concurrent logs per node.

## Configuration
- `hdds.container.ratis.datanode.storage.dir` (no default)
    - A list of metadata directory paths.
- `ozone.scm.datanode.pipeline.limit` (default: 2)
    - The maximum number of pipelines per datanode can be engaged in.
      The value 0 means that
      the pipeline limit per datanode will be determined
      by the number of metadata disks reported per datanode;
      see the next property.
- `ozone.scm.pipeline.per.metadata.disk` (default: 2)
    - The maximum number of pipelines for a datanode is determined
      by the number of disks in that datanode.
      This property is effective only when the previous property is set to 0.
      The value of this property must be greater than 0.

### Calculating Ratis Pipeline Limits

The target number of open, FACTOR_THREE Ratis pipelines is controlled by three properties that define the maximum number of pipelines in the cluster at a cluster-wide level, datanode level, and metadata disk level, respectively. SCM will create pipelines until the most restrictive limit is met.

1.  **Cluster-wide Limit (`ozone.scm.ratis.pipeline.limit`)**
    *   **Description**: An absolute, global limit for the total number of open, FACTOR_THREE Ratis pipelines across the entire cluster. This acts as a final cap on the total number of pipelines.
    *   **Default Value**: `0` (which means no global limit is enforced by default).

2.  **Datanode-level Fixed Limit (`ozone.scm.datanode.pipeline.limit`)**
    *   **Description**: When set to a positive number, this property defines a fixed maximum number of pipelines for every datanode. This is one of two ways to calculate a cluster-wide target.
    *   **Default Value**: `2`
    *   **Calculation**: If this is set, the target is `(<this value> * <number of healthy datanodes>) / 3`.

3.  **Datanode-level Dynamic Limit (`ozone.scm.pipeline.per.metadata.disk`)**
    *   **Description**: This property is used only when `ozone.scm.datanode.pipeline.limit` is explicitly set to `0`. It calculates a dynamic limit for each datanode based on its available metadata disks.
    *   **Default Value**: `2`
    *   **Calculation**: The limit for each datanode is `(<this value> * <number of metadata disks on that datanode>)`. The total cluster-wide target is the sum of all individual datanode limits, divided by 3.

#### How Limits are Applied

SCM first calculates a target number of pipelines based on either the **Datanode-level Fixed Limit** or the **Datanode-level Dynamic Limit**. It then compares this calculated target to the **Cluster-wide Limit**. The **lowest value** is used as the final target for the number of open pipelines.

**Example (Dynamic Limit):**

Consider a cluster with **10 healthy datanodes**.
*   **8 datanodes** have 4 metadata disks each.
*   **2 datanodes** have 2 metadata disks each.

And the configuration is:
*   `ozone.scm.ratis.pipeline.limit` = **30** (A global cap is set)
*   `ozone.scm.datanode.pipeline.limit` = **0** (Use dynamic calculation)
*   `ozone.scm.pipeline.per.metadata.disk` = **2** (Default)

**Calculation Steps:**
1.  Calculate the limit for the first group of datanodes: `8 datanodes * (2 pipelines/disk * 4 disks/datanode) = 64 pipelines`
2.  Calculate the limit for the second group of datanodes: `2 datanodes * (2 pipelines/disk * 2 disks/datanode) = 8 pipelines`
3.  Calculate the total raw target from the dynamic limit: `(64 + 8) / 3 = 24`
4.  Compare with the global limit: `min(24, 30) = 24`

SCM will attempt to create and maintain approximately **24** open, FACTOR_THREE Ratis pipelines.

**Production Recommendation:**

For most production deployments, using the dynamic per-disk limit (`ozone.scm.datanode.pipeline.limit=0`) is recommended, as it allows the cluster to scale pipeline capacity naturally with its resources. You can use the global limit (`ozone.scm.ratis.pipeline.limit`) as a safety cap if needed. A good starting value for `ozone.scm.pipeline.per.metadata.disk` is **2**. Monitor the `NumOpenPipelines` metric in SCM to see if the actual number of pipelines aligns with your configured targets.

## How to Use
1. Configure Datanode metadata directories:
   ```xml
   <property>
     <name>hdds.container.ratis.datanode.storage.dir</name>
     <value>/disk1/ratis,/disk2/ratis,/disk3/ratis,/disk4/ratis</value>
   </property>
   ```
2. Set pipeline limits in `ozone-site.xml`:
   ```xml
   <property>
     <name>ozone.scm.datanode.pipeline.limit</name>
     <value>0</value>
   </property>
   <property>
     <name>ozone.scm.pipeline.per.metadata.disk</name>
     <value>2</value>
   </property>
   ```
3. Restart SCM and Datanodes.
4. Validate with:
   ```bash
   ozone admin pipeline list
   ozone admin datanode list
   ```


## Operational Tips
- Monitor with `ozone admin` CLI and the Recon UI.
- Ensure pipeline count matches expectations.
  For optimal I/O isolation,
  configure `hdds.container.ratis.datanode.storage.dir`
  with paths on multiple distinct physical disks.
  The Ratis pipelines will be distributed accordingly.
  - Be cautious with very high pipeline counts due to memory/CPU overhead.

## Limitations
- Global configuration: cannot set per-node limits
- Requires restart after changing storage dirs
- No effect on Erasure-Coding (EC) pipelines
