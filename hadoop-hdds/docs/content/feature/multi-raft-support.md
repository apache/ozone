## Overview
The early Ozone versions supported one Raft pipeline per DataNode, which means each DataNode can accept only one write request at a time, leading to under-utilization of resources.

Multi-Raft support allows a DataNode to be part of multiple Ratis pipelines at once,
improving write throughput and ensuring better utilization of disk and network resources.
This is particularly useful when DataNodes have multiple disks.

## Prerequisites
- Ozone 0.5.0 or later
- Replication type: RATIS
- Multiple metadata volumes on each DataNode (via `hdds.container.ratis.datanode.storage.dir`)
- Adequate CPU, memory, and network bandwidth

## How It Works
SCM can now create overlapping pipelines: each DataNode can join multiple RAFT groups, up to a configurable limit. This boosts concurrency and avoids idle nodes. Raft logs are stored separately on different metadata volumes to reduce disk contention. Ratis handles concurrent logs per node.

## How to Use
1. Configure DataNode metadata volumes:
   ```xml
   <property>
     <name>dfs.container.ratis.datanode.storage.dir</name>
     <value>/disk1/ratis,/disk2/ratis</value>
   </property>
   ```
2. Set pipeline limits in `ozone-site.xml`:
   ```xml
   <property>
     <name>ozone.scm.datanode.pipeline.limit</name>
     <value>0</value>
   </property>
   <property>
     <name>ozone.scm.pipeline.per.metadata.disk</name>
     <value>2</value>
   </property>
   ```
3. Restart SCM and DataNodes.
4. Validate with:
   ```bash
   ozone admin pipeline list
   ozone admin datanode list
   ```

## Configuration
- `ozone.scm.datanode.pipeline.limit` (default: 2)
  - Set to `0` to auto-compute based on metadata volumes
- `ozone.scm.pipeline.per.metadata.disk` (default: 2)
  - Number of pipelines to be created per metadata volume.
- `dfs.container.ratis.datanode.storage.dir`: list of metadata volume paths

## Operational Tips
- Monitor with `ozone admin` CLI and Recon UI
- Ensure pipeline count matches expectations
- Balance Raft logs across disks
- Be cautious with very high pipeline counts (memory/CPU overhead)

## Limitations
- Global config: cannot set per-node limits
- Requires restart after changing storage dirs
- No effect on Erasure-Coding (EC) pipelines
