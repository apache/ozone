/**
 * A {@link javax.net.ssl.TrustManager} implementation for gRPC and Ratis
 * clients.
 *
 * This TrustManager instance is holding a reference to an externally supplied
 * TrustManager instance, and forwards all requests to that one.
 * This class is designed within the context of XceiverClientManager, where
 * we have the TrustManager initialized based on a ServiceInfo object, and
 * later on if the root of trust expires we need to refresh the rootCA
 * certificate for long-running clients to deal with a rootCA rotation if
 * necessary.
 *
 * The broader context where this class is usable is generally any place, where
 * clients are created based on a factory, and that factory can cache the
 * initial root of trust in this TrustManager, and a refresh mechanism as
 * necessary if the root of trust is expected to change for the certificate
 * of the server side.
 *
 * Note that in-memory provider is used to get the initial list of CA
 * certificates, that will be used to verify server side certificates.
 * In case of a certificate verification failure, the remote provider is used
 * to fetch a new list of CA certificates that will be used to verify server
 * side certificate from then on until the next failure.
 * Failures expected to happen only after a CA certificate that issued
 * the certificate of the servers is expired, or when the servers in preparation
 * for this expiration event renewed their certificates with a new CA.
 *
 * Important to note that this logic without additional efforts is weak against
 * a sophisticated attack, and should only be used with extra protection within
 * the remote provider. In Ozone's case the supplied remote provider is
 * an OzoneManager client, that verifies the identity of the server side
 * via Kerberos and expects the other side to be identified as an Ozone Manager.
 *
 * The checkClientTrusted methods throw Unsupported operation exceptions,
 * as this TrustManager instance is designed to be used only with client side
 * SSL channels.
