 * The protocol name that is used when a client and server connect.

 * Why override the default name (i.e. the class name)?
 * One use case overriding the default name (i.e. the class name) is when
 * there are multiple implementations of the same protocol, each with say a
 *  different version/serialization.
 * In Hadoop this is used to allow multiple server and client adapters
 * for different versions of the same protocol service.
