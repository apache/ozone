  /**
   * Calculates the delta of replicas which need to be created or removed

   * adds and deletes.
   *
   * When considering inflight operations, it is assumed any operation will
   * fail. However, to consider the worst case and avoid data loss, we always
   * assume a delete will succeed and and add will fail. In this way, we will
   * avoid scheduling too many deletes which could result in dataloss.
   *
   * Decisions around over-replication are made only on healthy replicas,
   * ignoring any in maintenance and also any inflight adds. InFlight adds are
   * ignored, as they may not complete, so if we have:
   *
   *     H, H, H, IN_FLIGHT_ADD
   *
   * And then schedule a delete, we could end up under-replicated (add fails,
   * delete completes). It is better to let the inflight operations complete
   * and then deal with any further over or under replication.
   *
   * For maintenance replicas, assuming replication factor 3, and minHealthy
   * 2, it is possible for all 3 hosts to be put into maintenance, leaving the
   * following (H = healthy, M = maintenance):
   *
   *     H, H, M, M, M
   *
   * Even though we are tracking 5 replicas, this is not over replicated as we
   * ignore the maintenance copies. Later, the replicas could look like:
   *
   *     H, H, H, H, M
   *
   * At this stage, the container is over replicated by 1, so one replica can be
   * removed.
   *
   * For containers which have replication factor healthy replica, we ignore any
   * inflight add or deletes, as they may fail. Instead, wait for them to
   * complete and then deal with any excess or deficit.
   *
   * For under replicated containers we do consider inflight add and delete to
   * avoid scheduling more adds than needed. There is additional logic around
   * containers with maintenance replica to ensure minHealthyForMaintenance
   * replia are maintained.
   *
