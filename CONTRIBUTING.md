## Building from source

### Requirements

Requirements to compile the code:

* Unix System
* JDK 1.8 or higher
* Maven 3.6 or later
* Internet connection for first build (to fetch all Maven and Ozone dependencies)

(Standard development tools such as make, gcc, etc. are required.)

### Build the project

After installing the requirements (especially Maven) build is as simple as:

```
mvn clean verify -DskipTests
```

### Useful Maven build options

  * Use `-DskipShade` to skip shaded Ozone FS jar file creation. Saves time, but you can't test integration with other software that uses Ozone as a Hadoop-compatible file system.
  * Use `-DskipRecon` to skip building Recon Web UI. It saves about 2 minutes.
  * Use `-Pdist` to build the binary tarball, similar to the one that gets released

## Running Ozone in Docker

Additional requirements for running Ozone in pseudo cluster (including acceptance tests):

* docker
* docker-compose
* [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) (utility used heavily by acceptance tests)

After building Ozone locally, you can start your first pseudo cluster:

```
cd hadoop-ozone/dist/target/ozone-*-SNAPSHOT/compose/ozone
OZONE_REPLICATION_FACTOR=3 ./run.sh -d
```

See more details in the [README](https://github.com/apache/ozone/blob/master/hadoop-ozone/dist/src/main/compose/ozone/README.md) and in the [docs](https://ozone.apache.org/docs/current/start.html).

## Contribute your modifications

We use GitHub pull requests for contributing changes to the repository. The main workflow is as follows:

  1. Fork [`apache/ozone`](https://github.com/apache/ozone) repository (first time) and clone it to your local machine
  2. Enable the `build-branch` GitHub Actions workflow (defined in `.github/workflows/post-commit.yml`) in your fork
  3. Ensure a Jira issue corresponding to the change exists in the [HDDS project](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/HDDS/) (eg. HDDS-1234)
     * Please search Jira before creating a new issue, someone might have already reported the same.
     * If this is your first issue, you might not be able to assign it to yourself.  If so, please make a comment in the issue, indicating that your are working on it.
  4. Create a local branch for your contribution (eg. `git checkout -b HDDS-1234`)
  5. Make your changes locally.
     * For complex changes, committing each logical part is recommended.
  6. Push your changes to your fork of Ozone
  7. Wait for the `build-branch` workflow to complete successfully for your commit.
  8. Create a pull request for your changes
     * Please include the Jira link, problem description and testing instruction (follow the [template](https://github.com/apache/ozone/blob/master/.github/pull_request_template.md))
  9. Set the Jira issue to "Patch Available" state
  10. Address any review comments if applicable
      * Create new, incremental commits in your branch.  This makes it easy for reviewers to only review the new changes. The committer will take care to squash all your commits when merging the pull request.
      * Push your commits in a batch, when no more changes are expected.  This reduces the burden on automated CI checks.
      * If you need to bring your PR up-to-date with the base branch (usually `master`), e.g. to resolve conflicts, please do so by merge, not rebase: `git merge --no-edit origin/master`.
      * In general, please try to avoid force-push when updating the PR.  Here are some great articles that explain why:
        * https://developers.mattermost.com/blog/submitting-great-prs/#4-avoid-force-pushing
        * https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/optimize-pull-requests-for-reviewer-happiness#request-a-review
    
## Code convention and tests

Basic code conventions followed by Ozone:

 * 2 spaces indentation
 * 80-char line length limit
 * Apache license header required in most files
 * no `@author` tags, authorship is indicated by Git history

These are checked by tools like Checkstyle and RAT.

### Check your contribution

The [`hadoop-ozone/dev-support/checks` directory](https://github.com/apache/ozone/tree/master/hadoop-ozone/dev-support/checks) contains scripts to build and check Ozone.  Most of these are executed by CI for every commit and pull request.  Running them before creating a pull request is strongly recommended.  This can be achieved by enabling the `build-branch` workflow in your fork and letting GitHub run all of the checks, but most of the checks can also be run locally.

 1. `build.sh`: compiles Ozone
 2. quick checks (less than 2 minutes)
    * `author.sh`: checks for `@author` tags
    * `bats.sh`: unit test for shell scripts
    * `rat.sh`: checks for Apache license header
    * `docs.sh`: sanity checks for [Ozone documentation](https://github.com/apache/ozone/tree/master/hadoop-hdds/docs)
    * `dependency.sh`: compares list of jars in build output with known list
    * `checkstyle.sh`: Checkstyle
 3. moderate (around 10 minutes)
    * `findbugs.sh`: SpotBugs
    * `kubernetes.sh`: very limited set of tests run in Kubernetes environment
 4. slow (around 1 hour or more)
    * `unit.sh`: pure unit tests
    * `integration.sh`: Java-based tests using single JVM "mini cluster"
    * `acceptance.sh`: rather complete set of tests in Docker Compose-based environment

The set of tests run by `integration` and `acceptance` may be limited via arguments, please see the scripts for details.  This is used by CI to run them in multiple splits to avoid taking too much time.

Some scripts require third-party tools, but most of these are installed during the first run, if needed.

Most scripts (except `build.sh`) output results in `target/<name>`, e.g. `target/docs`.

### False positive findbugs violation

If you have __very good__ reasons, you can ignore any Fingbugs warning. Your good reason can be persisted with the `@SuppressFBWarnings` annotation.

```java
@SuppressFBWarnings(value="AT_OPERATION_SEQUENCE_ON_CONCURRENT_ABSTRACTION",
      justification="The method is synchronized and this is the only place "+
          "dnsToUuidMap is modified")
private synchronized void addEntryTodnsToUuidMap(
...
```

## Using IDE

As Ozone uses Apache Maven it can be developed from any IDE.  IntelliJ IDEA is a common choice, here are some suggestions to use it for Ozone development.

### Run Ozone from IntelliJ

Ozone components depends on maven classpath. We generate classpath descriptor from the maven pom.xml files to use exactly the same classpath at runtime.

As a result, it's easy to start _all_ the components from IDE as the right classpath (without provided scope) has already been set.

To start Ozone from IntelliJ:

1. Stop your IDE
2. Execute the `./hadoop-ozone/dev-support/intellij/install-runconfigs.sh` helper script.
3. Start the IDE
4. New runner definitions are available from the Run menu.

You can use the installed Run configurations in the following order:

1. StorageContainerManagerInit (to initialize the SCM dir)
2. StorageContainerManger (to start SCM)
3. OzoneManagerInit (to initialize OM, it requires SCM)
4. OzoneManager
5. Recon (required by datanode)
6. Datanode1, Datanode2, Datanode3

### Setting up Checkstyle

Checkstyle plugin may help to detect violations directly from the IDE.

1. Install `Checkstyle+IDEA` plugin from `File` -> `Settings` -> `Plugins`
2. Open `File` -> `Settings` -> `Other settings` -> `Checkstyle` and Add (`+`) a new `Configuration File`
  * Description: `Ozone`
  * Use a local checkstyle `./hadoop-hdds/dev-support/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml`
3. Check the `pom.xml` for the current version of the used checkstyle and use the same version with the plugin (`File` -> `Settings` -> `Other settings` -> `Checkstyle`)
4. Open the _Checkstyle Tool Window_, select the `Ozone` rule and execute the check

### Common problems

#### Too large generated classes

IntelliJ may not pick up protoc generated classes as they can be very huge. If the protoc files can't be compiled try the following:

1. Open _Help_ -> _Edit custom properties_ menu.
2. Add `idea.max.intellisense.filesize=10000` entry
3. Restart your IDE

#### Bad class file

Sometimes during incremental build IDEA encounters the following error:

`bad class file: hadoop-hdds/common/target/classes/org/apache/hadoop/ozone/common/ChunkBufferImplWithByteBufferList$1.class`

Usually this can be fixed by removing the class file (outside of the IDE), but sometimes only by a full Rebuild.


## CI

The Ozone project uses Github Actions for its CI system.  The configuration is described in detail [here](.github/ci.md).
