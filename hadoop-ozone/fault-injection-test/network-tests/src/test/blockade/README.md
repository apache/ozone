## Blockade Tests
Following python packages need to be installed before running the tests :

1. blockade
2. pytest==2.8.7

Running test as part of the maven build:

mvn clean verify -Pit

Running test as part of the released binary:

You can execute all blockade tests with following command-lines:

```
cd $DIRECTORY_OF_OZONE
python -m pytest -s  tests/blockade/
```

You can also execute fewer blockade tests with following command-lines:

```
cd $DIRECTORY_OF_OZONE
python -m pytest -s  tests/blockade/<PATH_TO_PYTHON_FILE>
e.g: python -m pytest -s tests/blockade/test_blockade_datanode_isolation.py
```

You can change the default 'sleep' interval in the tests with following
command-lines:

```
cd $DIRECTORY_OF_OZONE
python -m pytest -s  tests/blockade/ --containerStatusSleep=<SECONDS>

e.g: python -m pytest -s  tests/blockade/ --containerStatusSleep=720
```

By default, second phase of the tests will not be run.
In order to run the second phase of the tests, you can run following
command-lines:

```
cd $DIRECTORY_OF_OZONE
python -m pytest -s  tests/blockade/ --runSecondPhase=true

```
