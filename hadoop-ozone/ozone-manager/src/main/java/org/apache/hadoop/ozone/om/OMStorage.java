 * Ozone Manager VERSION file representation.
 * On top of what is defined in the base Storage class, this class adds
 * functionality to hold Ozone Manager related data in its VERSION file.
 * The additional values stored:
 * - Ozone Manager ID - a UUID that identifies this Ozone Manager.
 *                      The value can not be changed once initialized, and
 *                      it is initialized automatically in this class.
 *                      The value itself is not used anymore, it is part of the
 *                      {@link org.apache.hadoop.hdds.protocol.proto.HddsProtos
 *                      .OzoneManagerDetailsProto} hence not removed yet.
 * - Ozone Manager Node Id - the node id defined for this Ozone manager in the
 *                           configuration. The value can not be changed after
 *                           it was set.
 * - Ozone Manager Certificate Serial Id - the serial id of the Ozone Manager's
 *                                         SSL certificate if one exists.
