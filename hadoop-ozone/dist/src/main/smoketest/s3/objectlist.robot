*** Test Cases ***

List objects with negative max-keys should fail
    ${result} =    Execute AWSS3APICli and checkrc    list-objects-v2 --bucket ${BUCKET} --max-keys -1    255
    Should Contain    ${result}    InvalidArgument

List objects with zero max-keys should fail
    ${result} =    Execute AWSS3APICli and checkrc    list-objects-v2 --bucket ${BUCKET} --max-keys 0    255
    Should Contain    ${result}    InvalidArgument

List objects with max-keys exceeding config limit should not return more than limit
    Prepare Many Objects In Bucket    1100
    ${result}=    Execute AWSS3APICli and checkrc    list-objects-v2 --bucket ${BUCKET} --max-keys 9999 --endpoint-url=${ENDPOINT_URL} --output json    0
    ${tmpfile}=   Generate Random String    8
    ${tmpfile}=   Set Variable    /tmp/result_${tmpfile}.json
    Create File   ${tmpfile}    ${result}
    ${count}=     Execute and checkrc    jq -r '.Contents | length' ${tmpfile}    0
    Should Be True    ${count} <= 1000
    Remove File   ${tmpfile}

List objects with max-keys less than config limit should return correct count
    Prepare Many Objects In Bucket    1100
    ${result}=    Execute AWSS3APICli and checkrc    list-objects-v2 --bucket ${BUCKET} --max-keys 500 --endpoint-url=${ENDPOINT_URL} --output json    0
    ${tmpfile}=   Generate Random String    8
    ${tmpfile}=   Set Variable    /tmp/result_${tmpfile}.json
    Create File   ${tmpfile}    ${result}
    ${count}=     Execute and checkrc    jq -r '.Contents | length' ${tmpfile}    0
    Should Be True    ${count} == 500
    Remove File   ${tmpfile}

Check Bucket Ownership Verification
    Prepare Many Objects In Bucket                                1
    ${correct_owner} =    Get bucket owner                        ${BUCKET}

    Execute AWSS3APICli with bucket owner check                   list-objects-v2 --bucket ${BUCKET}  ${correct_owner}
