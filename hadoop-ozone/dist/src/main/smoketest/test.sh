 Acceptance test executor for ozone.

 This is a lightweight test executor for ozone.

 You can run it with

     ./test.sh

 Which executes all the tests in all the available environments.

 Or you can run manually one test with

 ./test.sh --keep --env ozone-hdfs basic

     --keep  means that docker cluster won't be stopped after the test (optional)
     --env defines the subdirectory under the compose dir
     The remaining parameters define the test suites under smoketest dir.
     Could be any directory or robot file relative to the smoketest dir.
