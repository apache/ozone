*** Test Cases ***
Testing OM DB Size Reduction After Compaction
    [Setup]    Create Test Keys
    
    # Delete keys to create tombstones that need compaction
    Delete Test Keys
    
    ${size_before_compaction} =    Get OM DB SST Files Size

    Compact OM DB Column Family    fileTable
    Compact OM DB Column Family    deletedTable
    Compact OM DB Column Family    deletedDirectoryTable
    
    ${size_after_compaction} =    Get OM DB SST Files Size

    Should Be True    ${size_after_compaction} < ${size_before_compaction}
    ...    OM DB size should be reduced after compaction. Before: ${size_before_compaction}, After: ${size_after_compaction}
