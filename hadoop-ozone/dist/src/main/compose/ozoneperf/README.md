# Compose files for local performance tests

This directory contains docker-compose definition for an ozone cluster where
all the metrics are saved to a prometheus instance.

Prometheus follows a pull based approach where the metrics are published
 on a HTTP endpoint.

Prometheus compatible metrics endpoint can be enabled by setting `hdds.prometheus.endpoint.enabled` property to `true`

## How to start

Start the cluster with `docker-compose`

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Note: The freon test will be started after 30 seconds.

## How to use

You can check the ozone web ui-s:

https://localhost:9874
https://localhost:9876

You can check the ozone metrics from the prometheus we ui.

http://localhost:9090/graph
