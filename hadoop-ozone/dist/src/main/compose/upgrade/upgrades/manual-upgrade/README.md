# Manual Upgrade Testing

- Since the release of Ozone's non-rolling upgrade framework in 1.2.0, no manual reformatting steps need to be run on nodes between upgrades.

- The driver for testing this type of upgrade is left here as an example in case it needs to be used for some reason in the future.
