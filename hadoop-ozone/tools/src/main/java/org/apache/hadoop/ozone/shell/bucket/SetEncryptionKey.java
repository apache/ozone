/**
 * Command-line tool to set the encryption key of a bucket.
 *
 * There are known bugs, HDDS-7449 and HDDS-7526, which could potentially result
 * in the loss of bucket encryption properties when either quota or bucket
 * replication properties are (re)set on an existing bucket, posing a critical
 * issue. This may affect consumers using previous versions of Ozone.
 *
 * To address this bug, this CLI tool provides the ability to (re)set the
 * Bucket Encryption Key (BEK) for HDDS-7449/HDDS-7526 affected buckets using
 * the Ozone shell.
 *
 * Users can execute the following command for setting BEK for a given bucket:
 * "ozone sh bucket set-encryption-key -k <enckey> <vol>/<buck>"
 *
 * Please note that this operation only resets the BEK and does not modify any
 * other properties of the bucket or the existing keys within it.
 *
 * Existing keys in the bucket will retain their current properties, and any
 * keys added before the BEK reset will remain unencrypted. Keys added after the
 * BEK reset will be encrypted using the new BEK details provided.
 *
 * @deprecated This functionality is deprecated as it is not intended for users
 * to reset bucket encryption post-bucket creation under normal circumstances
 * and may be removed in the future. Users are advised to exercise caution and
 * consider alternative approaches for managing bucket encryption unless
 * HDDS-7449 or HDDS-7526 is encountered. As a result, the setter methods and
 * this CLI functionality have been marked as deprecated, and the command has
 * been hidden.
