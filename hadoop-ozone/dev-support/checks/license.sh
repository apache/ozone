# This script checks if all third-party dependencies have licenses we can use.
# Optionally accepts the aggregated third-party license list file to be checked.
# Otherwise it requires Ozone to be available from Maven repo (can be local),
# so that it can generate the license list.
#
# When adding a new dependency to Ozone with a license that fails to match:
# * verify that the license is allowed, ref: https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html
# * tweak the patterns to allow
#
# Items for which license-maven-plugin cannot find license (e.g. jettison,
# jsp-api) are output as "Unknown license".  These dependencies should be
# filtered explicitly by adding them to the `license.exceptions` file, instead
# of allowing the generic "Unknown license".
