# This script does common processing after Maven-based checks.
#
# - ensures Maven error is reported as failure
# - writes number of failures into file
# - exits with the correct code

# Prerequisites:
# - $rc should be set to Maven exit code
# - $REPORT_DIR should be defined
# - $REPORT_FILE should be defined
# - Maven output should be saved in $REPORT_DIR/output.log

# script failed, but report file is empty (does not reflect failure)
if [[ ${rc} -ne 0 ]] && [[ ! -s "${REPORT_FILE}" ]]; then
  # do we know what to look for?
  if [[ -n "${ERROR_PATTERN:-}" ]]; then
    grep -m25 "${ERROR_PATTERN}" "${REPORT_DIR}/output.log" > "${REPORT_FILE}"
  fi
  if [[ ! -s "${REPORT_FILE}" ]]; then
    echo "Unknown failure, check output.log" > "${REPORT_FILE}"
  fi
fi

# number of failures = number of lines in report, unless file already created with custom count
if [[ ! -s "${REPORT_DIR}/failures" ]]; then
  wc -l "$REPORT_FILE" | awk '{ print $1 }' > "$REPORT_DIR/failures"
fi

# exit with failure if report is not empty
