The Ozone REST API's allows user to access ozone via  REST protocol.

## Authentication and Authorization

For time being, The default authentication mode of REST API is insecure access
mode, which is *Simple* mode. Under this mode, ozone server trusts the user
name specified by client and it does not perform any authentication.

User name can be specified in HTTP header by

* `x-ozone-user: {USER_NAME}`

for example if add following header *x-ozone-user: bilbo* in the HTTP request,
then operation will be executed as *bilbo* user.
In *Simple* mode, there is no real authorization either. Client can be
authorized to obtain administrator privilege by using HTTP header

* `Authorization: {AUTH_METHOD} {SIGNATURE}`

for example set following header *Authorization: OZONE root* in the HTTP request,
then ozone will authorize the client with administrator privilege.

## Common REST Headers

The following HTTP headers must be set for each REST call.

| Property | Description |
|:---- |:----
| Authorization | The authorization field determines which authentication method is used by ozone. Currently only *simple* mode is supported, the corresponding value is *OZONE*. Optionally an user name can be set as *OZONE {USER_NAME}* to authorize as a particular user. |
| Date | Standard HTTP header that represents dates. The format is - day of the week, month, day, year and time (military time format) in GMT. Any other time zone will be rejected by ozone server. Eg. *Date : Mon, Apr 4, 2016 06:22:00 GMT*. This field is required. |
| x-ozone-version | A required HTTP header to indicate which version of API this call will be communicating to. E.g *x-ozone-version: v1*. Currently ozone only publishes v1 version API. |

## Common Reply Headers

The common reply headers are part of all Ozone server replies.

| Property | Description |
|:---- |:----
| Date | This is the HTTP date header and it is set to serverâ€™s local time expressed in GMT. |
| x-ozone-request-id | This is a UUID string that represents an unique request ID. This ID is used to track the request through the ozone system and is useful for debugging purposes. |
| x-ozone-server-name | Fully qualified domain name of the sever which handled the request. |

## Volume APIs
