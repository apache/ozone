Overview
--------

Freon is a load-generator for Ozone. This tool is used for testing the functionality of ozone.

### Random keys

In randomkeys mode, the data written into ozone cluster is randomly generated.
Each key will be of size 10 KB.

The number of volumes/buckets/keys can be configured. The replication type and
factor (eg. replicate with ratis to 3 nodes) Also can be configured.

For more information use

`bin/ozone freon --help`

{{< highlight bash >}}
ozone freon randomkeys --numOfVolumes=10 --numOfBuckets 10 --numOfKeys 10  --replicationType=RATIS --factor=THREE
