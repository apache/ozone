If Recon has no bucket data, respond with: *“Recon did not find any buckets currently registered in the cluster.”*

---

## **Schema: ContainerMetadata**

**Purpose:**

Represents metadata for all containers tracked by Recon. Used by the `/containers` endpoint to list every container with its total count, pagination key, and key statistics.

---

### **Structure**

**Root Object:**

### **data fields**

- **`totalCount`** *(integer)* — Total number of containers included in the response.

  *Example:* `3`

- **`prevKey`** *(integer)* — Key offset for pagination. Used to fetch the next set of containers after this key in subsequent queries.

  *Example:* `3019`

- **`containers[]`** *(array of objects)* — List of individual container metadata entries.

---

### **Container Object Fields**

Each container entry contains the following fields:

- **`ContainerID`** *(integer)* — Unique numeric identifier for the container.

  *Example:* `1`

- **`NumberOfKeys`** *(integer)* — Count of keys (objects/files) stored within this container.

  *Example:* `834`

---

### **Example Response**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "totalCount": 3,
    "prevKey": 3019,
    "containers": [
      { "ContainerID": 1, "NumberOfKeys": 834, "pipelines": null },
      { "ContainerID": 2, "NumberOfKeys": 833, "pipelines": null },
      { "ContainerID": 3, "NumberOfKeys": 833, "pipelines": null }
    ]
  }
}

```

---

### **Usage Notes**

- Use `totalCount` to summarize the total containers Recon is aware of.
- Use `prevKey` for pagination when fetching large container sets.
- Each container’s `NumberOfKeys` gives a quick density measure of object distribution.
- The `pipelines` field is primarily used to trace replication topologies or identify pipeline failures.

---

### **Example Natural-Language Mappings (for Gemini)**

- “How many containers exist?” → return `data.totalCount`
- “List all container IDs.” → iterate over `data.containers[].ContainerID`
- “How many keys are in container 1?” → `NumberOfKeys` where `ContainerID=1`
- “What pipeline is container 5 using?” → `pipelines` for that container

---

Here’s the **Gemini-optimized documentation block** for the `DeletedContainers` schema — structured for clarity, prompt-friendly interpretation, and consistent with the earlier Recon API sections:

### **Key Insights for Gemini**

- When the user asks for *“missing containers”*, Gemini should use `/containers/missing`.
- If the user requests *“when a container went missing”*, extract `missingSince`.
- For *replica history of missing containers*, read nested `replicas[]`.
- Combine `keys` with `totalCount` for aggregate impact summaries.
- If no containers are missing, respond: *“All containers are currently accounted for; no missing entries found.”*

---

Here’s the **Gemini-optimized documentation** for the `UnhealthyContainerMetadata` schema — fully structured to convey every field’s role, logical relationships, and query mapping for intelligent question answering:

---

## **Schema: UnhealthyContainerMetadata**

**Purpose:**

Represents all containers in an **unhealthy state**, including missing, under-replicated, over-replicated, and mis-replicated containers.

Used by `/containers/unhealthy` and `/containers/unhealthy/{state}` endpoints to summarize container-level health issues in the Ozone cluster.

---

### **Top-Level Fields**

- **`missingCount`** *(integer)* — Number of containers currently in the **MISSING** state.

  *Example:* `2`

- **`underReplicatedCount`** *(integer)* — Number of containers that have fewer replicas than expected.

  *Example:* `0`

- **`overReplicatedCount`** *(integer)* — Number of containers that have more replicas than expected.

  *Example:* `0`

- **`misReplicatedCount`** *(integer)* — Number of containers that are misaligned with the expected replication policy (e.g., data placement violation).

  *Example:* `0`

- **`containers[]`** *(array)* — Detailed information for each container identified as unhealthy.

---

### **Container Object Fields**

Each entry in the `containers[]` array describes one unhealthy container:

- **`containerID`** *(integer)* — Unique ID of the unhealthy container.

  *Example:* `1`

- **`containerState`** *(string)* — Health category of the container:

  Possible values: `MISSING`, `UNDER_REPLICATED`, `OVER_REPLICATED`, `MIS_REPLICATED`.

  *Example:* `"MISSING"`

- **`unhealthySince`** *(number)* — Epoch timestamp when Recon first identified the container as unhealthy.

  *Example:* `1605731029145`

- **`expectedReplicaCount`** *(integer)* — Number of replicas expected based on the container’s replication configuration.

  *Example:* `3`

- **`actualReplicaCount`** *(integer)* — Number of replicas currently detected across all Datanodes.

  *Example:* `0`

- **`replicaDeltaCount`** *(integer)* — Difference between expected and actual replicas.

  Positive values mean missing replicas; negative values mean excess replicas.

  *Example:* `3`

- **`reason`** *(string)* — Explanation of why the container is unhealthy (optional; may be null).

  *Example:* `"Missing replicas detected"`

- **`keys`** *(integer)* — Number of keys associated with the container. Indicates how much user data may be impacted.

  *Example:* `7`

- **`pipelineID`** *(string)* — UUID of the pipeline that originally hosted this container.

  *Example:* `"88646d32-a1aa-4e1a"`

- **`replicas[]`** *(array of `ReplicaHistory` objects)* — List of replica history entries showing last known replica details (host, timestamps, state, etc.) for diagnosis.

  See `ReplicaHistory` schema for structure.

```json
{
  "missingCount": 2,
  "underReplicatedCount": 0,
  "overReplicatedCount": 0,
  "misReplicatedCount": 0,
  "containers": [
    {
      "containerID": 1,
      "containerState": "MISSING",

          "lastBcsId": 123,
          "state": "OPEN"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

```

---

### **Usage Notes**

- Each unhealthy category (`MISSING`, `UNDER_REPLICATED`, `OVER_REPLICATED`, `MIS_REPLICATED`) can be queried separately using `/containers/unhealthy/{state}`.
- `unhealthySince` helps track the duration of container unavailability.
- `replicaDeltaCount` quantifies severity: higher values indicate more missing replicas.
- The nested `replicas[]` list provides historical context for the Datanodes previously hosting the container.
- This schema is useful for identifying root causes of cluster imbalance or data risk.

---

### **Natural-Language Query Mappings (for Gemini)**

| **User Query Example** | **Relevant Field(s)** | **Action / Endpoint** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| “List all unhealthy containers.” | `containers[].containerID` | `/containers/unhealthy` |
| “How many missing containers are there?” | `missingCount` | `/containers/unhealthy` |
| “Show all under-replicated containers.” | `underReplicatedCount` + `containers[]` | `/containers/unhealthy/UNDER_REPLICATED` |
| “When did container 10 become unhealthy?” | `unhealthySince` | `/containers/unhealthy` |
| “What’s the replication difference for container 15?” | `replicaDeltaCount` | `/containers/unhealthy` |
| “Which Datanodes last hosted container 5?” | `replicas[].datanodeHost` | `/containers/unhealthy` |

---

### **Model Behavior Guide (for Gemini)**

- Use `/containers/unhealthy` when the query includes generic phrases like *“unhealthy containers,” “replication issues,” “missing data,”* or *“replica imbalance.”*
- Use `/containers/unhealthy/{state}` when the query specifies *missing, under-replicated, over-replicated,* or *mis-replicated.*
- If the user asks *“Why is this container unhealthy?”* → check `reason` or infer from `expectedReplicaCount` vs `actualReplicaCount`.
- For *impact analysis*, use `keys` (how many objects are affected).
- When no unhealthy containers are found, reply:

  *“All containers are currently healthy; no unhealthy entries detected by Recon.”*


---

Here’s a **fully detailed and Gemini-optimized documentation** for both schemas — `MismatchedContainers` and `DeletedMismatchedContainers`.

Every field, sub-object, and logical relationship is explicitly covered to ensure complete understanding and reliable natural-language mapping.

---

## **Schema: MismatchedContainers**

**Purpose:**

Describes discrepancies between **OM (Ozone Manager)** and **SCM (Storage Container Manager)** regarding container existence or metadata.

Used by the `/containers/mismatch` endpoint to identify containers that exist in one component but not the other, or whose replication configuration or state is inconsistent.

---

### **Top-Level Fields**

- **`lastKey`** *(integer)* — Marker used for pagination to retrieve the next set of mismatch records.

  *Example:* `21`

- **`containerDiscrepancyInfo[]`** *(array)* — List of objects representing each mismatched container and its details.

---

### **Container Discrepancy Object Fields**

Each object in `containerDiscrepancyInfo` represents one container that exhibits an inconsistency between OM and SCM:

### **Container Information**

- **`containerId`** *(integer)* — Unique identifier of the container showing mismatch.

  *Example:* `11`

- **`numberOfKeys`** *(integer)* — Number of keys (objects) associated with this container, as known to OM.

  *Example:* `1`


### **Pipeline Information**

- **`pipelines[]`** *(array)* — List of pipeline objects linked to this container.

  A container can have multiple associated pipelines if replication states changed over time.


Each pipeline entry includes:

- **`id`** *(object)* — Pipeline identifier.
  - **`id`** *(string)* — UUID representing the specific pipeline.

    *Example:* `"1202e6bb-b7c1-4a85-8067-61374b069adb"`

- **`replicationConfig`** *(object)* — Describes replication parameters used by the pipeline.
  - **`replicationFactor`** *(string)* — Number of replica copies configured (e.g., `ONE`, `TWO`, `THREE`).

    *Example:* `"THREE"`

  - **`requiredNodes`** *(integer)* — Number of datanodes expected to hold replicas.

    *Example:* `3`

  - **`replicationType`** *(string)* — Type of replication method (e.g., `RATIS`, `STAND_ALONE`, `EC`).

    *Example:* `"RATIS"`

- **`healthy`** *(boolean)* — Indicates if the pipeline was considered healthy when the mismatch was detected.

  *Example:* `true`


### **Existence Information**

- **`existsAt`** *(string)* — Location of the mismatch; identifies where the container exists but should not.

  Possible values:

  - `"OM"` → container exists in OM metadata but missing in SCM.
  - `"SCM"` → container exists in SCM but missing in OM.

    *Example:* `"OM"`

### **Example Response**

```json
{
  "lastKey": 21,
  "containerDiscrepancyInfo": [
    {
      "containerId": 2,
      "numberOfKeys": 2,
      "pipelines": [
        {
          "id": { "id": "1202e6bb-b7c1-4a85-8067-61374b069adb" },
          "replicationConfig": {
            "replicationFactor": "ONE",
            "requiredNodes": 1,
            "replicationType": "RATIS"
          },
          "healthy": true
        }
      ],
      "existsAt": "OM"
    },
    {
      "containerId": 11,
      "numberOfKeys": 2,
      "pipelines": [
        {
          "id": { "id": "1202e6bb-b7c1-4a85-8067-61374b069adb" },
          "replicationConfig": {
            "replicationFactor": "TWO",
            "requiredNodes": 2,
            "replicationType": "RATIS"
          },
          "healthy": true
        },
        {
          "id": { "id": "1202e6bb-b7c1-4a85-8067-613724nn" },
          "replicationConfig": {
            "replicationFactor": "ONE",
            "requiredNodes": 1,
            "replicationType": "RATIS"
          },
          "healthy": true
        }
      ],
      "existsAt": "SCM"
    }
  ]
}

```

---

### **Usage Notes**

- These mismatches often occur when container state updates fail to sync between OM and SCM.
- `existsAt` determines which subsystem has the extra entry.
- `pipelines` help identify whether replication topology differences contributed to the mismatch.
- Healthy pipelines (`healthy: true`) indicate that container mismatch is likely due to metadata, not physical corruption.
- Used mainly for **reconciliation audits** between OM and SCM databases.

---

### **Natural-Language Mappings (for Gemini)**

| **User Query Example** | **Relevant Field(s)** | **Recommended Endpoint** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| “Show all containers that exist in OM but not in SCM.” | `existsAt: OM` | `/containers/mismatch?missingIn=SCM` |
| “Which containers are mismatched between OM and SCM?” | `containerDiscrepancyInfo[]` | `/containers/mismatch` |
| “How many keys are stored in mismatched container 11?” | `numberOfKeys` | `/containers/mismatch` |
| “Show pipeline details for container 2.” | `pipelines[]` | `/containers/mismatch` |
| “Which mismatched containers use RATIS replication?” | `replicationConfig.replicationType` | `/containers/mismatch` |

---

### **Gemini Behavior Guide**

- Use `/containers/mismatch` for queries involving **OM–SCM mismatches** or **metadata inconsistencies**.
- If the user mentions *“containers missing in SCM”* → filter where `existsAt = "OM"`.
- If the user mentions *“containers missing in OM”* → filter where `existsAt = "SCM"`.
- When analyzing replication or data integrity, extract from `replicationConfig` and `healthy`.
- For multi-page results, use `lastKey` for pagination.
- If no mismatches exist, respond with:

  *“All containers are consistent between OM and SCM; no mismatches found.”*


---

## **Schema: DeletedMismatchedContainers**

**Purpose:**

Represents containers that are **deleted in SCM** but **still present in OM metadata**.

Used by `/containers/mismatch/deleted` endpoint to find orphaned entries that should be purged or reconciled.

---

### **Top-Level Fields**

- **`lastKey`** *(integer)* — Pagination marker for retrieving additional results.

  *Example:* `21`

- **`containerDiscrepancyInfo[]`** *(array)* — List of container discrepancy records (same structure as in `MismatchedContainers`).

---

### **Container Discrepancy Object Fields**

- **`containerId`** *(integer)* — ID of the container found deleted in SCM but still existing in OM.

  *Example:* `11`

- **`numberOfKeys`** *(integer)* — Number of keys inside the container as known to OM.

  *Example:* `1`

- **`pipelines[]`** *(array)* — List of associated pipeline records, same structure as in `MismatchedContainers`:
  - **`id.id`** *(string)* — Pipeline UUID.
  - **`replicationConfig`** *(object)* with:
    - `replicationFactor` *(string)* — e.g., `ONE`, `TWO`, `THREE`.
    - `requiredNodes` *(integer)* — Expected replica node count.
    - `replicationType` *(string)* — e.g., `RATIS`, `STAND_ALONE`, `EC`.
  - **`healthy`** *(boolean)* — Indicates pipeline health.
- **`existsAt`** *(string)* *(optional in this schema)* — Often omitted, implicitly `"OM"` since these mismatches are OM-side remnants.

---

          "healthy": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

```

---

### **Usage Notes**

- Indicates **residual metadata** in OM that was not cleaned up after SCM deletion.
- Typically occurs during partial or failed container deletion workflows.
- Used by Recon to guide **cleanup and reconciliation jobs**.
- Since all entries here exist only in OM, the `existsAt` field is optional but implied.
- Can be cross-checked with `/containers/deleted` (active SCM deletions).

---

### **Natural-Language Mappings (for Gemini)**

| **User Query Example** | **Relevant Field(s)** | **Recommended Endpoint** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| “Show containers deleted in SCM but still visible in OM.” | `containerDiscrepancyInfo[]` | `/containers/mismatch/deleted` |
| “List orphaned containers in OM.” | `containerId` | `/containers/mismatch/deleted` |
| “Which replication type do these deleted containers use?” | `replicationConfig.replicationType` | `/containers/mismatch/deleted` |
| “How many keys remain in deleted containers?” | `numberOfKeys` | `/containers/mismatch/deleted` |

---

### **Gemini Behavior Guide**

- Use `/containers/mismatch/deleted` when queries mention *deleted containers still appearing in OM* or *inconsistent deletion*.
- Combine with `/containers/mismatch` when user requests *all types of container mismatches*.
- Use pipeline information to determine whether mismatch is purely metadata or linked to replication.
- If none found, respond:

  *“No deleted containers remain in OM; SCM and OM container metadata are consistent.”*


---

```

---

### **Usage Notes**

- Enables detailed tracing of **where key data physically resides**.
- Essential for debugging block corruption, replication issues, and incomplete multipart uploads.
- `underConstruction` helps detect partially written blocks.
- Fields are often nested inside higher-level structures (`VersionLocation` → `LocationList`).

---

### **Natural-Language Mappings (for Gemini)**

| Query | Field |
| --- | --- |
| “Show physical blocks for a key.” | `locationLists[].blockID.containerBlockID` |
| “Where is version 3 of this key stored?” | `version` + `locationVersionMap` |
| “How big is each block?” | `length` |
| “Which container hosts this block?” | `containerID` |
| “Are there blocks still under construction?” | `underConstruction` |

---

### **Gemini Behavior Guide**

- Use `OpenKeys` and `OpenKeysSummary` for **active/open file tracking**.
- Use `OMKeyInfoList` to access **static metadata** for stored or versioned keys.
- Traverse `VersionLocation → LocationList → blockID` to resolve **data lineage** and **physical storage mapping**.
- Respond with hierarchical clarity when users ask “where”, “how big”, or “how replicated” questions.
- If `nonFSO` is empty, clarify that only FSO-based open keys exist.
- For incomplete uploads or multipart debugging, check `multipartKey` and `underConstruction`.

      "localIDCount": 4,
      "txID": 1
    }
  ]
}

```

---

### **Usage Notes**

- Identifies un-cleaned blocks even after key deletion.
- `txID` ties the pending operation to SCM or OM transaction logs.

  ],
  "sizeDirectKey": 10000
}

```

---

- Helps visualize data skew across directories or buckets.
- Commonly paired with `MetadataDiskUsage` for per-bucket dashboards.

---

### **Natural-Language Mappings**

| Query | Field |
| --- | --- |
| “Show size distribution of objects under bucket1.” | `dist[]` |
| “Which buckets contribute most to storage usage?” | Analyze non-zero indices of `dist[]` |

### **Gemini Behavior Guide (Summary)**

- For cluster-level queries → use **ClusterState**.
- For node-level health and capacity → use **DatanodesSummary**.
- For removed or decommissioning nodes → use **RemovedDatanodesResponse** or **DatanodesDecommissionInfo**.
- For raw capacity metrics → use **StorageReport** (nested in multiple schemas).
- For encoding checks → use **ByteString**.

This textual structure gives Gemini both semantic understanding (purpose, usage, relationships) and low-level grounding (exact field names and examples).

Here’s a **complete and Gemini-optimized documentation block** for the

`DatanodeDetails` schema. Every parameter is included and concisely explained so the model can interpret, map, and reason over it without ambiguity.

### **Usage Notes**

- Used heavily for **replica placement**, **decommission tracking**, and **rack awareness visualization**.
- `cost` and `level` help Ozone compute network distance for data placement.
- `persistedOpState` and `decommissioned` reveal the node’s current administrative role.
- `networkFullPath` and `numOfLeaves` are useful for topology map generation in Recon.
- The various `AsByteString` fields exist for consistent protobuf serialization but can usually be ignored in user queries.

---

### **Natural-Language Query Mappings (for Gemini)**

| Example Query | Map To |
| --- | --- |
| “Where is DataNode dn1 located in the network?” | `networkLocation`, `networkFullPath` |
| “What is the IP and port for DataNode localhost-1?” | `ipAddress`, `ports[]` |
| “Is this node under maintenance or decommissioned?” | `maintenance`, `decommissioned` |
| “What is the DataNode’s operational state?” | `persistedOpState` |
| “Which rack is this node part of?” | `networkName`, `parent` |
| “When was this DataNode registered?” | `setupTime` |
| “What version and build revision is it running?” | `version`, `revision`, `buildDate` |

---

### **Gemini Behavior Guide**

- Use `DatanodeDetails` whenever queries involve **specific node identity**, **network placement**, or **state management**.
- Prefer textual fields (`ipAddress`, `hostName`, `networkLocation`) for user-facing responses; the `ByteString` variants exist only for internal matching.
- Combine with `DatanodesDecommissionInfo` when user asks “Which nodes are decommissioning?” or “Show detailed info for node X.”

      "replicationType": "RATIS",
      "replicationFactor": 3,
      "containers": 3
    }
  ]
}

```

---

### **Usage Notes**

- A **pipeline** groups DataNodes used for block replication and I/O coordination.
- The **leaderNode** handles write ordering and Raft consensus for RATIS pipelines.
- **duration** and **leaderElections** help identify unstable pipelines that frequently reform.
- **containers** quantifies how much data traffic flows through each pipeline.
- When combined with `DatanodesSummary`, Recon can show pipeline-to-node relationships and leadership distribution.

---

### **Natural-Language Query Mappings (for Gemini)**

| Example Query | Maps To |
| --- | --- |
| “List all pipelines in the cluster.” | `pipelines[]` |
| “Show the leader node of each pipeline.” | `leaderNode` |
| “How many pipelines are open?” | `status` |
| “Which pipelines use RATIS replication?” | `replicationType` |
| “What is the replication factor for pipeline b9415b20?” | `replicationFactor` |
| “Show how long each pipeline has been running.” | `duration` |
| “Which pipelines have undergone leader elections?” | `leaderElections`, `lastLeaderElection` |
| “How many containers are assigned per pipeline?” | `containers` |
| “List DataNodes participating in pipeline X.” | `datanodes[]` |

---

### **Gemini Behavior Guide**

- Use `PipelinesSummary` for all user intents involving **replication groups**, **leaders**, or **container-to-pipeline mappings**.
- When a query includes keywords like “RATIS,” “pipeline,” “replica,” “leader,” or “container group,” this schema is most relevant.
- Combine with `DatanodesSummary` for topology-aware explanations (e.g., “Which rack hosts all nodes of this pipeline?”).
- If `status = CLOSED`, the pipeline should be excluded from write path discussions.

---

This version includes every parameter, short one-line summaries for all fields (including nested arrays), structured examples, and clear guidance for Gemini’s context reasoning.

Here is the **complete, Gemini-optimized documentation** for the `TasksStatus` schema — written in the same detailed, field-by-field format as your previous ones, with full parameter coverage, context, and reasoning guidance.

---

## **Schema: TasksStatus**

**Purpose:**

Represents the **latest execution state and progress** of background Recon tasks (such as OM Delta sync, Missing Container scans, or Key Mapping tasks).

Returned by the `/task/status` endpoint to monitor task freshness, completion order, and synchronization cycles.

---

### **Fields**

Each entry in the array corresponds to one background task being tracked by Recon.

- **taskName** *(string)* — Name of the background task or service module reporting status.

  Identifies which component of Recon (e.g., `OmDeltaRequest`, `ContainerKeyMapper`, `FileSizeCountTaskFSO`, etc.) last updated its internal checkpoint.

  *Example:* `"OmDeltaRequest"`

- **lastUpdatedTimestamp** *(number)* — Epoch timestamp (in milliseconds) when this task last successfully ran or synchronized data.

  Used to detect staleness or verify that a task is running on schedule.

  *Example:* `1605724099147`

- **lastUpdatedSeqNumber** *(number)* — Last sequence number or transaction checkpoint processed by the task.

  Indicates how far Recon has ingested data (e.g., OM transaction sequence).

  Higher numbers represent newer sync progress.

  *Example:* `186`


---

### **Example**

```json
[
  {
    "taskName": "OmDeltaRequest",
    "lastUpdatedTimestamp": 1605724099147,
    "lastUpdatedSeqNumber": 186
  },
  {
    "taskName": "OmDeltaRequest",
    "lastUpdatedTimestamp": 1605724103892,
    "lastUpdatedSeqNumber": 188
  }
]

```

---

### **Usage Notes**

- Used by the **Recon Tasks Dashboard** to show when each background service last completed execution.
- Critical for **monitoring data freshness** between Ozone Manager, SCM, and Recon DBs.
- A growing gap between `lastUpdatedSeqNumber` and OM transaction IDs indicates **sync lag**.
- `lastUpdatedTimestamp` allows for quick checks of **task health and scheduling cadence**.
- Useful for diagnosing why Recon data (e.g., container states, key counts) appears outdated.

---

### **Natural-Language Query Mappings (for Gemini)**

| Example Query | Maps To |
| --- | --- |
| “When did Recon last sync with OM?” | `lastUpdatedTimestamp` where `taskName = OmDeltaRequest` |
| “Which tasks have not updated recently?” | Compare `lastUpdatedTimestamp` values |
| “What is the current sequence number for OM delta sync?” | `lastUpdatedSeqNumber` |
| “Is Recon lagging behind OM updates?” | Evaluate difference between `lastUpdatedSeqNumber` and OM’s known latest sequence |
| “List all background tasks and their update times.” | Iterate over all `taskName` entries |

---

### **Gemini Behavior Guide**

- Use this schema when queries involve **Recon sync progress**, **task freshness**, or **lag detection**.
- Keywords like *“last updated,” “task progress,” “delta sync,” “background service,”* or *“status of tasks”* map directly here.
- If timestamps differ greatly across tasks, suggest Recon restart or deeper inspection of lag sources.
- When multiple tasks share the same name but have different timestamps, report the most recent update as the **active instance**.

---

This version covers every field in `TasksStatus`, includes clear operational meaning, examples, and precise mappings for Gemini to reason about synchronization and background processing health.

---

Here is the **complete, Gemini-optimized documentation** for the `FileSizeUtilization` schema — following the same structure, depth, and tone as your previous sections. Every parameter is covered and concisely summarized with examples and reasoning context for model comprehension.

---

## **Schema: FileSizeUtilization**

**Purpose:**

Represents the **distribution of files across volumes and buckets by size category and count**.

Returned by the `/utilization/filesize` endpoint in Recon to show how many files exist of specific sizes within each bucket.

Used for analyzing **storage utilization trends**, **file size skew**, and **capacity consumption patterns**.

---

### **Fields**

Each entry in the array describes a unique combination of volume, bucket, and file-size grouping.

- **volume** *(string)* — Name of the Ozone **volume** containing the files.

  Identifies the logical namespace root under which the bucket resides.

  *Example:* `"vol-2-04168"`

- **bucket** *(string)* — Name of the **bucket** under the specified volume.

  Represents the immediate container grouping for files (keys) of this size class.

  *Example:* `"bucket-0-11685"`

- **fileSize** *(number)* — Size (in bytes) of the file or file group represented by this record.

  Each record aggregates all files of the same size under a given volume/bucket pair.

  *Example:* `1024`

- **count** *(integer)* — Number of files (keys) found with the exact or approximate file size defined in `fileSize`.

  Indicates how many files contribute to that utilization point.

  *Example:* `1`


---

### **Example**

```json
[
  { "volume": "vol-2-04168", "bucket": "bucket-0-11685", "fileSize": 1024, "count": 1 },
  { "volume": "vol-2-04168", "bucket": "bucket-1-41795", "fileSize": 1024, "count": 1 },
  { "volume": "vol-2-04168", "bucket": "bucket-2-93377", "fileSize": 1024, "count": 1 },
  { "volume": "vol-2-04168", "bucket": "bucket-3-50336", "fileSize": 1024, "count": 2 }
]

```

---

### **Usage Notes**

- Used in Recon to **quantify data distribution** by file size across volumes and buckets.
- Each record represents aggregated counts of files with identical or rounded sizes.
- Helps identify **hot buckets** (those with many small files) or **storage inefficiency** (many tiny keys inflating metadata).
- Supports **capacity planning** by correlating `fileSize × count` for total storage consumption per bucket.
- May be combined with `MetadataDiskUsage` or `MetadataSpaceDist` for richer cluster utilization analytics.

---

### **Interpretation Example**

If the dataset shows many entries with `fileSize = 1024` and high `count` values across multiple buckets,

it implies heavy use of small files — common in workloads with metadata-intensive operations or frequent small writes.

---

### **Natural-Language Query Mappings (for Gemini)**

| Example Query | Maps To |
| --- | --- |
| “Show how many files exist per bucket by size.” | `volume`, `bucket`, `fileSize`, `count` |
| “Which buckets have the most small files?” | Filter where `fileSize` < threshold, sort by `count` |
| “What is the total number of 1 KB files?” | Aggregate all entries where `fileSize = 1024`, sum `count` |
| “List buckets under vol-2-04168 with large files.” | Filter by `volume`, sort by descending `fileSize` |
| “How is file size distributed across volumes?” | Group by `volume`, aggregate `fileSize × count` |

---

### **Gemini Behavior Guide**

- Use this schema for **data size analytics**, **file count summaries**, and **storage optimization queries**.
- When the query includes phrases like *“file size utilization,” “file count by bucket,” “how many small files,”* or *“storage distribution,”* this schema applies.
- For broader space usage (including replicas), correlate with `MetadataDiskUsage`.
- If user asks for totals or averages, aggregate across `count` and `fileSize` fields.
- If `fileSize` appears constant across many buckets, highlight uneven data spread as a cluster optimization insight.

---

This section includes every parameter in the `FileSizeUtilization` schema, a short yet explicit summary for each field, complete operational context, example data, and reasoning logic to guide Gemini’s semantic mapping and query handling.

Here is the **complete Gemini-optimized documentation** for the `ContainerUtilization` schema — every parameter included, one-line summaries for each, clear examples, and detailed behavioral guidance for context-aware use.

---

## **Schema: ContainerUtilization**

**Purpose:**

Represents the **distribution of container sizes and counts** across the Ozone cluster.

Returned by the `/utilization/containers` endpoint in Recon.

Used to analyze **how many containers exist at specific size levels**, identify imbalance, and assist in capacity planning.

---

### **Fields**

Each record in the array corresponds to one container size category and the number of containers that fall into it.

- **containerSize** *(number)* — The size (in bytes) of containers within this utilization group.

  Reflects total data stored in each container class.

  Often reported as powers of two (e.g., 1 GB, 2 GB).

  *Example:* `2147483648`

- **count** *(number)* — Number of containers that have the specified `containerSize`.

  Indicates the frequency or volume distribution of containers by size.

  *Example:* `9`


---

### **Example**

```json

### **Usage Notes**

- Used to **analyze space allocation patterns** among Ozone containers.
- Helps detect uneven data distribution across pipelines or DataNodes.
- A large number of smaller containers can imply fragmented writes or high namespace churn.
- Larger container groups indicate bulk or aggregated data usage patterns.
- Useful for **capacity diagnostics**, **container balancing**, and **replication efficiency monitoring** in Recon dashboards.

---

### **Interpretation Example**

If `containerSize = 2 GB` has a higher count than `1 GB`, the cluster stores most data in full-sized containers.

If smaller containers dominate, it may indicate premature container closures or frequent small writes.

### **Natural-Language Query Mappings (for Gemini)**

| Example Query | Maps To |
| --- | --- |
| “How many containers are 2 GB in size?” | Filter where `containerSize = 2147483648`, read `count` |
| “List all container sizes and their counts.” | Iterate through `containerSize` and `count` |
| “What is the most common container size in the cluster?” | Highest `count` value |
| “Show container size distribution.” | Aggregate full array of `containerSize` vs `count` |
| “Are most containers small or large?” | Compare counts between lower and higher size ranges |

---

### **Gemini Behavior Guide**

- Use `ContainerUtilization` when queries mention *“container size,” “container distribution,” “storage utilization per container,”* or *“how many containers of size X.”*
- When user queries require percentage or trend analysis, compute relative proportions of `count` for each `containerSize`.
- For total capacity estimation, multiply `containerSize × count` and sum across entries.
- Integrate with `FileSizeUtilization` for combined container-to-file size analytics.
- If no containers are listed, infer that Recon’s container scan hasn’t completed or that all containers are currently empty.
