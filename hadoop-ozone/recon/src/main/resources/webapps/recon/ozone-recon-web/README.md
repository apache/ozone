This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/) as package manager. To install pnpm, follow the instructions [here](https://pnpm.js.org/en/installation).
After installation, run `pnpm install` to install dependencies for the first time.    

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `pnpm run dev`

Starts a mock json server to serve mock API responses and the frontend app in the development mode in parallel.

### `pnpm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `pnpm run mock:api`

Runs a mock json server in port 9888. During development, always run the mock api server to see mock response in the frontend. 

### `pnpm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `pnpm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
